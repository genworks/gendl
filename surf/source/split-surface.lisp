                  "Given a NURBS and a parameter in U or V direction,
split the surface at the parameter and return one section or the other as the 
toplevel self of this instance. Note that both resulting sections are also 
reflected in (the surfaces) sequence which is a hidden child in this object.

As an alternative to a parameter, a projection-point and projection-vector 
can also be given, and the U or V parameter at the resulting surface point
will be used as the parameter.
