 (Yes, the curves need to be planar )
 
   1.  offset each curve by the given radius R
   2.  intersect the two offset curves for the center point C of the circle
   3.  project the center point back to each curve to get
        P1 at t1 on the first curve and P2 at t2 on the second curve
   4.  split each curve at t1 and t2
   5.  delete the ends of each curve
   6.  build the circular arc, center C, radius r from P1 to P2.
