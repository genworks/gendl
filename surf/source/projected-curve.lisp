  :documentation (:description "Creates a 3D curve which is the <tt>curve-in</tt> 
projected onto the <tt>surface.</tt> according to the <tt>projection-vector</tt>. 
The resulting curve contains a uv-curve which is typically useful for trimming.

NOTE: Change from 1577p027 and forward -- the projected curve now is a 3D curve which 
can be drawn. It contains its uv representation on the surface. Previously, the uv-curve
was the actual projected-curve.
