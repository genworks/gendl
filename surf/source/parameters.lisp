NURBS curves with cubic beziers for display with PDF and GWL web-based

for very small objects at the expense of speed, larger values sacrifice 
display fidelity for better speed. Default value is 0.01, which should give 
decent performance but might give distorted rendering for extremely small objects. 
This could be made to be somewhat adaptive, i.e. resetting itself on the fly 
to a smaller value when dealing with smaller curves. Please let us know if you 
think this would be useful.

Note that 3rd degree non-rational curves do not require approximation and are not
affected by this paramter.
