  :documentation (:description "Creates a smooth blend-surface between curve-1, lying on surface-1 and curve-2 on surface-2. 

Note that curve-1 and curve-2 have to be so-called on-surface curves, which means they must answer a uv-curve message which is the UV representation of the curve on the given surface. The most common way to establish an on-surface curve is to use an iso-curve to begin with, or to use a projected-curve or dropped-curve to ensure that the curve is indeed an on-surface curve.

The local start and end directions of this surface at any point along curve-1 and curve-2 are determined from the cross-product between the tangent to the surface's u- or v-iso-curve (the one that is closest to being parallel to curve-1 or curve-2) at this point and the corresponding surface-normal at the same point. In this fashion a tangent blend is created between surface-1 and surface-2 that extends in a direction that follows and smoothly interpolates both surface's iso-curves. Takes the same inputs as general-dual-blend-surface, except for f-tangent-1 and f-tangent-2."
