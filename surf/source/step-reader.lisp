  :documentation (:description "This object will reflect the contents of a STEP file containing
points, curves, surfaces, and/or trimmed surfaces as sequences of GDL objects. Currently all
surfaces are treated as trimmed, where actual untrimmed surfaces have their natural outer 
boundaries as the result-island, i.e. no standalone surfaces will be produced by this part. 

This is a default option in the HarmonyWare STEP Translator which will be exposed in GDL
in a future release.

The HarmonyWare reader creates a log file in a temporary directory. The location of this log
file is printed on the console during the reading operation. Currently this log file is
not automatically deleted, and its name is determined by the system.
