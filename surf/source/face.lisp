  :documentation (:description "This object represents a (possibly) trimmed surface contained within a brep. It answers
all the local messages of face, and it has surface mixed in as well, so it will answer all the surface messages. Note 
however that the local surface messages will operate on the basis, not on the trimmed representation. The messages 
for face will operate on the trimmed representation.

This object is not meant for direct instantiation; rather, a brep will contain a quantified set of faces (called \"faces\"),
and trimmed surface also mixes in face, so a trimmed-surface will answer all the face messages.")
