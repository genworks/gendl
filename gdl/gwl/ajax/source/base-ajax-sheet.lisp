  :documentation (:description "(Note: this documentation will be moved
to the specific docs for the html-format/base-ajax-sheet lens, when 
we have lens documentation working properly)

Produces a standard main-sheet for html-format which includes the
standard GDL Javascript to enable code produced with gdl-ajax-call to
work, and optionally to include the standard JQuery library.

If you want to define your own main-sheet, then there is no use for
base-ajax-sheet, you can just use base-html-sheet. But then you have
to include any needed Javascript yourself, e.g. for gdl-ajax-call
support or jQuery.

The html-format lens for base-ajax-sheet also defines a user hook function,
main-sheet-body, which produces a \"No Body has been defined\" message by default, 
but which you can fill in your own specific lens to do something useful for the body."
