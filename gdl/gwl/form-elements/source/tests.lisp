Congressman Ron Paul is the leading advocate for freedom in our nation's capital. 
As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Paul tirelessly works for limited 
constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies. 
He is known among his congressional colleagues and his constituents for his consistent 
voting record. Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly 
authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, 
Dr. Paul is the one exception to the Gang of 535 on Capitol Hill.")
