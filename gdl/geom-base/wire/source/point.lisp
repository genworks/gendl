the crosshair will always appear in a ``top'' view regardless of the current view transform. The crosshair will
not scale along with any zoom state unless the <tt>scale?</tt> optional input-slot is non-NIL. The default
color for the crosshairs is a light grey (:grey-light-very in the *color-table*)."
