  (:description "GDL currently supports third-degree Bezier curves, which are 
defined using four 3D <i>control-points</i>. The Bezier curve always passes 
through the first and last control points and lies within the convex hull of the control 
points. At the start point (i.e. the first control point), the curve is tangent 
to the vector pointing from the start point to the second control point. 
At the end point (i.e. the last control point), the curve is tangent to the 
vector pointing from the end point to the third control point."
