  :documentation (:description "Block of text typeset using cl-typesetting. This object
wraps the typeset block as a standard GDL object, so it can be placed in a view and 
positioned according to normal GDL positioning.

You can specify the width, and by default this object will compute its length automatically 
from the typeset content, to fit all the lines of text into the box. Because of this 
computed behavior of the length, the center of the box will not, in general, be in a 
known location compared to the start of the text. Because of this it is recommended
to use :corner, rather than :center, for positioning a base-view which contains
a typeset block. 

In the normal case, if you want a single block in a view on a drawing, you should
make the base-view object have the same width and length as the typeset-block. The
base-view should also probably have :left-margin 0 and :front-margin 0.")
