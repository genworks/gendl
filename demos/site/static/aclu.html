According to our Bylaws, The Foundation aims to promote the use and
development of the Common Lisp programming language by:


<ol>
<li>promoting and facilitating meetings, conferences and networking
    opportunities;</li>
 
<li> promoting the development of de-facto standard functionality for
     Common Lisp with publicly available source code</li>

<li>other allied activities which will be consistent with the
     above-stated aims, as well as anything reasonably connected
     therewith and/or may be instrumental in achieving the stated aim,
     given the broadest application.  anything which is connected
     therewith and/or may be beneficial for the above purpose, taken
     in the broadest sense of the word.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Currently, the Foundation is active in sponsorship and financial
administration for the <a href=http://weitz.de/eclm2013/>2013 European Common Lisp Meeting</a>
scheduled to take place June 2, 2013 in Madrid. The Foundation is also
investigating the possibility of managing donations for Common Lisp
related community projects.
