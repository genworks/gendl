surfaces and Solids modeling kernel, based on the SMLib product from Solid Modeling Solutions, Inc. The combination of 
GDL and SMLib adds powerful surface and solids capabilities to GDL's built-in 3D wireframe facilities. SMLib provides 
extensible filleting, as well as full support for non-manifold topology (e.g. edges sharing more than two faces) 
for boundary-representation solids. Along with the dynamic modeling capability, the SMLib option also provides input 
and output support for the standard IGES and STEP formats as well as the possibility of direct CAD translation."))
