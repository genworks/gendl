   	   principally as an independent contract-programmer for area
   	   companies, notably General Motors Corp, Visteon, Ford Motor
   	   Company, and others, working with their respective KBE
   	   tools to perfect and deliver applications. Beginning in the
   	   early 2000s, Genworks shifted its attention to creating and
   	   developing its own independent KBE tool and accompanying
   	   software, efforts which resulted in the development of its
   	   \"GDL\" tool, which stands for General-Purpose Declarative
   	   Language (see the layman's Glossary in our website as
   	   needed).  In a few short years, Genworks, in a measured and
   	   deliberate manner, has developed a growing client-base in
   	   the U.S, UK, and the European continent.")
