  Genworks International Gendl Trial License Agreement
  ======================================================

By downloading and/or accessing the distribution media for this Gendl
GDL Entitlement, and/or using the included Gendl software, you agree
to the terms and conditions of the Genworks International Trial
License Agreement. Please read this agreement before installing and/or
using the accompanying Gendl software product.

The main intention of Genworks in making available a Gendl Trial
Edition is to provide a small-scale introductory evaluation
opportunity for companies and individuals who have a serious and
sincere interest in obtaining commercial licenses for Genworks
products. The Trial Edition does not include the necessary features or
Technical Support from Genworks to enable large-scale use or
production deployment. It should not be expected that a self-guided
Trial will clarify all issues relevant to a particular intended
commercial/production deployment. Please contact the Genworks
Technical Sales Department for information regarding customized
application prototypes and analysis of your particular
enterprise/infrastructure.

The Genworks International ("Genworks") Gendl Trial Edition
Development System ("Trial Edition") is subject to certain
restrictions in the accompanying Genworks license agreement, and is
designed to be used for learning, evaluating, and demonstrating to
yourself the capabilities of the tool. The Trial Edition consists of
three parts: a binary distribution containing a commercial core Common
Lisp engine (currently Allegro CL is available), a License Key File,
source code for the Gendl development software licensed under the Gnu
Affero General Public License, documentation in human-readable
electronic format, and (optionally) a binary distribution of a
commercial Solid Modeling kernel (currently SMLib is available). This
License Agreement applies to the binary parts of the distribution and
to the License Key File. The Affero General Public License continues
to apply to the source code part of the distribution.

Commercial and certain academic use of the Trial Edition are strictly
prohibited without Genworks' prior written consent. For example, the
Genworks Trial License forbids you to use the Trial Edition to provide
services or products to others for which you are compensated, or may
in the future be compensated (by payment of money or otherwise,
directly or indirectly), in any manner.

The Trial Edition may be used for a certain number of days, as
specified in the license key file and in the startup banner when
running the Software. While in some situations the Trial Edition
license may be extended beyond this period on a limited basis, in
general, before the expiration of the trial period, you will need to
contact Genworks to purchase a commercial Gendl development license
in order to continue using the Gendl development system beyond the
trial period. ANY ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT OR DELAY THE EXPIRATION DATE
SPECIFIED IN THE STARTUP BANNER WILL CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF CONTRACT
AND COPYRIGHT VIOLATION, AND WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO GENWORKS VARIOUS
LEGAL REMEDIES.

It is important that you read carefully and agree to the provisions of
the attached license agreement. These provisions detail the
obligations imposed on you for using this software.
