  Genworks International Gendl Student License Agreement
  ======================================================

By breaking the seal on the Gendl Student CD envelope, downloading, and/or
using the Gendl software, you agree to the terms and conditions of the
Genworks International Student License Agreement. Please read this
agreement before installing and/or using the accompanying Gendl
software product.

The main intention of Genworks in making available a Gendl Student
Edition is to provide a small-scale introductory evaluation
opportunity for companies and individuals who have a serious and
sincere interest in obtaining commercial licenses for Genworks
products. The Student Edition does not include the necessary features
or Technical Support from Genworks to enable large-scale use or
production deployment. It should not be expected that a self-guided
Student use will clarify all issues relevant to a particular intended
commercial/production deployment. Please contact the Genworks
Technical Sales Department for information regarding customized
application prototypes and analysis of your particular
enterprise/infrastructure.

The Genworks International ("Genworks") Gendl Student Edition
Development System ("Student Edition") is subject to certain
restrictions in the accompanying Genworks license agreement, and is
designed to be used for learning, evaluating, and demonstrating to
yourself the capabilities of the tool. The Student Edition consists of
three parts: a binary distribution containing the Gendl development
software, documentation in human-readable electronic format, and a
License Key File. This License Agreement applies to the use of all of
these parts.

Commercial and certain academic use of the Student Edition are strictly
prohibited without Genworks' prior written consent. For example, the
Genworks Student License forbids you to use the Student Edition to provide
services or products to others for which you are compensated, or may
in the future be compensated (by payment of money or otherwise,
directly or indirectly), in any manner.

The Student Edition may be used for a certain number of days, as
specified in the license key file and in the startup banner when
running the Software. While in some situations the Student Edition
license may be extended beyond this period on a limited basis, in
general, before the expiration of the trial period, you will need to
contact Genworks to purchase a commercial Gendl development license
in order to continue using the Gendl development system beyond the
trial period. ANY ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT OR DELAY THE EXPIRATION DATE
SPECIFIED IN THE STARTUP BANNER WILL CONSTITUTE A BREACH OF CONTRACT
AND COPYRIGHT VIOLATION, AND WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO GENWORKS VARIOUS
LEGAL REMEDIES.

It is important that you read carefully and agree to the provisions of
the attached license agreement. These provisions detail the
obligations imposed on you for using this software.
