* Layout

For each package FOO to be simulated, there is a file
"package-foo.lisp". Its package definition is in "package.lisp".

The package definition should look like this:

  (defpackage #:foo
    (:use)
    (:export #:with-frobnicating
             ...))

Code in "package-foo.lisp" is not (in-package foo); instead, it's
(in-package zacl). Any functions, macros, or variables to be defined
in FOO should be written like so:

  (defun foo:with-frobnicating (&body body) ...)

That is, the name should use the package prefix. Double-colons is fine
if that's how it's used in practice.
