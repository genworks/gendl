;;; Commentary:

;; The `minibuffer-complete' command, bound by default to TAB in the
;; minibuffer completion keymaps, displays the list of possible
;; completions when no additional characters can be completed.
;; Subsequent invocations of this command cause the window displaying
;; the *Completions* buffer to scroll, if necessary.
;; 
;; This library advises the `minibuffer-complete' command so that
;; subsequent invocations instead select each of the possible
;; completions in turn, inserting it into the minibuffer and
;; highlighting it in the *Completions* buffer.  As before, the window
;; displaying the possible completions is scrolled if necessary.  This
;; feature is enabled by loading this file and setting the
;; `minibuffer-complete-cycle' option to t with `M-x customize-variable'
;; or `M-x set-variable'; it is disabled by unsetting the option (to
;; nil).  Besides t, the special value `auto' enables the feature and
;; also causes the first completion to be selected immediately.
;; 
;; You can also customize the `minibuffer-complete-cycle' face, which is
;; used to highlight the selected completion, with `M-x customize-face'
;; or any of the `M-x set-face-' commands.

;; The technique of deleting the minibuffer contents, then (for file
;; name completion) inserting the directory component of the initial
;; input, and then inserting the completion string itself is based on
;; cycle-mini.el (1.03) by Joe Reiss <jreiss@vt.edu>.
