;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Resize all windows vertically to display as much information as possible
;; with the command `M-x pack-windows'.
;;
;; Only windows that are on the left edge of the frame are taken into
;; account. The vertical space available in the frame is first divided
;; among all these windows. Then any window requireing less lines than it
;; got to display its whole buffer is shrinked, and the freed space is
;; divided equally among all the other windows.
;;
;; If some vertical space remains afterwards, it is given in totality to
;; the currently selected window.
;;
;; Do not shrink any window to less than `window-min-height'.
;;
;; Shrink windows iteratively, performing at most `pack-windows-max-iteration'
;; iterations. The number of iterations really performed will be
;; displayed in the echo area if `pack-windows-verbose' is non-nil.

;; Incorporated modifications by Peter S Galbraith <psg@debian.org>:
;; - standardised prefix to pack-windows- (instead of pw-),
;; - added a defgroup,
;; - added an autoload tag for the main function,
;; - added a Commentary field,
;; - made some changes suggested by M-x checkdoc.
