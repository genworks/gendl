;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a simple way to navigate among marks in a
;; buffer.  C-u C-SPC is similar, but takes you haphazardly around the
;; buffer.  Setting bookmarks is a lot of extra work if you just want
;; to jump around your buffer quickly; plus, you have to come up with
;; a name for every bookmark.

;; All the marks you've left while editing a buffer serve as bread
;; crumb trails of areas in the buffer you've edited.  It is
;; convenient to navigate back and forth among these marks in order.
;; This file provides two methods to do just that, marker-visit-prev
;; and marker-visit-next.  These two functions will take you, from
;; point, to the nearest mark in either direction.  The function
;; marker-visit-truncate-mark-ring will truncate the mark ring.

;; The marks you can visit in a buffer consist of: "the mark" plus the
;; contents of the mark-ring.

;;; Usage:

;; put this file in your load-path and add the line
;;
;; (require 'marker-visit)
;;
;; to your ~/.emacs file.
;;
;; This package is most useful when some easy-to-press keys are bound
;; to the functions marker-visit-prev and marker-visit-next.  See C-h
;; i m Emacs RET m Key Bindings RET for info on emacs key bindings.

;;; History:

;; 1.0 -> 1.1 Incorporated patch from Colin Walters to make the code
;; consistent with elisp code conventions mentioned in 
;; (Info-goto-node "(elisp) Coding Conventions").

;;; Code:

   (t (cons (car ls) (marker-visit-remove-dupes (cdr ls))))))

;;create a sorted list of marks, including the point as mark, the
;;mark, and the contents of the mark-ring.
