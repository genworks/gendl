;;; Commentary:

;;; The macro keydef provides a simplified interface to define-key that
;;; smoothly handles a number of common complications.

;;; The global-set-key command isn't ideal for novices because of its
;;; relatively complex syntax. And I always found it a little
;;; inconvenient to have to quote the name of the command---that is, I
;;; tend to forget the quote every once in a while and then have to go
;;; back and fix it after getting a load error.

;;; One of the best features is that you can give an Emacs lisp form (or
;;; even a series of forms) as the key definition argument, instead of a
;;; command name, and the keydef macro will automatically add an
;;; interactive lambda wrapper. I use this to get, for example, a more
;;; emphatic kill-buffer command (no confirmation query) by writing
;;;
;;;   (keydef "<S-f11>" (kill-buffer nil))
;;;
;;; For keydef the key sequence is expected to be given uniformly in the
;;; form of a string for the 'kbd' macro, with one or two refinements
;;; that are intended to conceal from users certain points of confusion,
;;; such as (for those whose keyboards lack a Meta key) the whole
;;; Meta/ESC/escape muddle.

;;; I have had some trouble in the past regarding the distinction
;;; between ESC and [escape] (in a certain combination of circumstances
;;; using the latter form caused definitions made with the other form to
;;; be masked---most puzzling when I wasn't expecting it). Therefore the
;;; ESC form is actually preprocessed a bit to ensure that the binding
;;; goes into esc-map.

;;; There is one other special feature of the key sequence syntax
;;; expected by the keydef macro: You can designate a key definition for
;;; a particular mode-map by giving the name of the mode together with
;;; the key sequence string in list form, for example
;;;
;;;   (keydef (latex "C-c %") comment-region)
;;;
;;; This means that the key will be defined in latex-mode-map. [The
;;; point of using this particular example will be made clear below.] I
;;; arranged for the mode name to be given in symbol form just because I
;;; didn't want to have to type extra quotes if I could get away with
;;; it. For the same reason this kind of first arg is not written in
;;; dotted pair form.

;;; If the given mode-map is not defined, keydef "does the right thing"
;;; using eval-after-load. In order to determine what library the
;;; mode-map will be loaded from, it uses the following algorithm:
;;;
;;; First check if foo-mode has autoload information. If not, check
;;; whether "foo-mode" is the name of a library that can be found
;;; somewhere in the load-path (using locate-library); otherwise check
;;; whether "foo" is the name of a locatable library. Failing that, give
;;; up and return nil.
;;;
;;; There is a fall-back mechanism, however, to handle exceptional
;;; cases. If foo-mode-map is undefined but the list mode-map-alist
;;; contains an entry of the form (foo-mode-map foo-other-name-map),
;;; then foo-other-name-map is used as the name of the
;;; keymap.
;;;
;;; If the mode-map is not loaded yet AND the command being bound to a
;;; key is undefined at the time of the keydef assignment, it presents
;;; further problems. The simplest solution is to assume that after the
;;; package is loaded that defines the mode-map, the given command will
;;; be defined and satisfy commandp. With some extra effort it should be
;;; possible to determine more accurately whether the command will be
;;; defined or not, but I'm not sure I want to go to that extreme, since
;;; as far as I can see it would require opening the package file and
;;; searching through it for a matching defun/defalias/fset statement.
;;;
;;; If the mode name matches the mode map name, but foo-mode is not
;;; autoloaded, then some autoload information may need to be provided.
;;; For example, the following line allows definitions to be made for
;;; debugger-mode-map even before debug.el is loaded.
;;;
;;;  (autoload 'debugger-mode "debug" "Autoloaded." 'interactive)
;;;
;;; Although there is no easy way provided by keydef for
;;; gnus-summary-limit-map to be accessed directly, because
;;; its name does not include "mode", you can get a binding into
;;; such a map by writing
;;;
;;;   (keydef (gnus-summary "/ z") gnus-summary-limit-to-zapped)
;;;
;;; which binds /z in gnus-summary-mode-map, which is equivalent to
;;; binding z in gnus-summary-limit-map.
;;;
;;; You might need to add an autoload statement for gnus-summary-mode
;;; in order for this to work, so that keydef knows that it should use
;;; eval-after-load and that the file the mode function will be loaded
;;; from is called "gnus-sum" rather than "gnus-summary-mode". (If it
;;; were the latter, keydef would be able to resolve everything
;;; automatically.)

;;; We COULD HAVE just put the definitions into the mode hook in the
;;; standard way, instead of using eval-after-load, but that would mean
;;; the key definitions get executed repetitiously every time the mode
;;; function gets called, which seems better to avoid, if only for
;;; esthetic reasons (if it can be done without too much trouble).

;;; The following examples show some typical keydef lines followed by the
;;; results of the macro expansion.

;;; Simplest kind of definition:
;;;
;;; (keydef "C-x m" gnus-group-mail)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd "C-x m") (quote gnus-group-mail))

;;; What if the command name is misspelled?
;;;
;;; (keydef "C-x m" gnus-gruop-mail)
;;;
;;;   -->(message "keydef: gnus-gruop-mail unknown \
;;;                \(perhaps misspelled, or not loaded yet\)")

;;; A leading ESC gets special handling to go through esc-map.
;;;
;;; (keydef "ESC &" query-replace-regexp)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd "&") (quote query-replace-regexp))

;;; Undefine a key:
;;;
;;; (keydef "ESC `")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd "`") nil)

;;; If the second arg is a string, keydef defines the given key sequence
;;; as a keyboard macro. The following macro puts in TeX-style double
;;; quotes and then moves the cursor backward to leave it in the middle:
;;;
;;; (keydef "\"" "``''\C-b\C-b")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd "\"") "``''\002\002")

;;; Reset a key to self-insert
;;;
;;; (keydef "\"" "\"")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd "\"") (quote self-insert-command))

;;; If the second arg is a list, wrap it in an interactive lambda form.
;;;
;;; (keydef "C-z"
;;;   (message "Control-Z key disabled---redefine it if desired."))
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map
;;;       (kbd "C-z")
;;;       (lambda (arg)
;;;         "anonymous keydef function"
;;;         (interactive "p")
;;;         (message "Control-Z key disabled---redefine it if desired.")))
;;;
;;; Note that the interactive lambda wrapper added by keydef, when the
;;; CMD does not satisfy commandp, always takes a single prefix argument
;;; named "arg", which is read in the usual way with (interactive "p");
;;; so this could be used in the body of the function if need be.

;;; This shows the notation for F-keys.
;;;
;;; (keydef "<C-f17>" (kill-buffer nil))
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map
;;;       (kbd "<C-f17>")
;;;       (lambda (arg)
;;;         "*Anonymous function created by keydef."
;;;         (interactive "p")
;;;         (kill-buffer nil)))

;;; Because of the confusing Meta/Escape complications, I recommend to
;;; the users that I support that they use the ESC notation
;;; consistently if that is what they type from their keyboard, even
;;; for F-key definitions that might normally be written with <M-...>
;;; notation.
;;;
;;; (keydef "ESC <f3>" find-file-read-only)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd "<f3>") (quote find-file-read-only))

;;; The next two definitions go together. The second one shows how to
;;; write a mode-specific definition.
;;;
;;; (keydef "<f5>" isearch-forward)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd "<f5>") (quote isearch-forward))
;;;
;;; (keydef (isearch "<f5>") isearch-repeat-forward)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "<f5>")
;;;                                   (quote isearch-repeat-forward))

;;; Making a definition for a mode-map that is not loaded yet.
;;;
;;; (keydef (latex "C-c %") comment-region)
;;;
;;;   -->(eval-after-load "tex-mode"
;;;        (quote
;;;         (define-key latex-mode-map
;;;           (kbd "C-c %")
;;;           (quote comment-region))))

;;; TO DO:
;;;
;;; ---If someone wants to do massive alterations or additions to a
;;; mode-map that is not yet loaded, it might be a good idea to
;;; provide another macro that will bundle them into a single
;;; eval-after-load call rather than dozens of separate ones.
;;;
;;; ---More error-checking would probably be a good idea, when SEQ
;;; satisfies listp but the contents of the list are not usable in the
;;; way that we expect.

;; This variable is needed because the information is not readily
;; available for look-up in any other way. (Well, I don't want to get
;; into defadvice'ing use-local-map and stuff like that.)

if latex-mode is not loaded yet, provided that it is possible to deduce
the file that it will be loaded from, either from the autoload info or

named sh-mode-map. The common cases that I know about, including
