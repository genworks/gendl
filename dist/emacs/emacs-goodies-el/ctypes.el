;;{{{ Documentation

;; Background:
;;
;; As most Emacs users know, Emacs can fontify source code buffers
;; using the `font-lock' package.  Most of the time it does a really
;; good job.  Unfortunately, the syntax of one of the most widely
;; spread languages, C, makes it difficult to fontify variable
;; declarations.  For example, what does the following line mean:
;;
;;     hello(foo * bar);
;;
;; 1) A new function `hello' that takes one argument `bar' that is a
;;    pointer to a `foo', or;
;;
;; 2) call the function `hello' with the result of `foo' multiplied
;;    by `bar'.
;;
;; To answer the question correctly you must know whether `foo' is a
;; type or not.  Unfortunately, font-lock has no way of knowing this.

;; This package:
;;
;; This package can search through source files hunting down typedefs.
;; When found, font-lock is informed and your source code will be even
;; more beautifully colored than before.
;;
;; Each major mode has it's own set of types.  It is possible for one
;; major mode to inherit the types of another mode.
;;
;; Currently, this package can parse C and C++ files.  (However, since
;; I do not use C++, the probability is high (about 12, on a scale
;; from 1 to 12) that I've missed something).  By default C++ inherits
;; the types defined for C mode.

;; Installation:
;;
;; Place this file in any directory in the emacs load path
;; and add the following line to your init file:
;;  (require 'ctypes)
;;
;; Or, if you should prefer to load ctypes only when needed:
;;
;; (defun my-activate-ctypes () (require 'ctypes))
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-activate-ctypes)
;; (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'my-activate-ctypes)
;;
;; Of course, you must also activate font-lock.  I also recomend using
;; lazy-lock since adding types requires refontification of all
;; buffers.  (Should you use many small buffers, consider lowering
;; `lazy-lock-minimum-size' aswell.)

;; Defining types:
;;
;; The following commands are available to define and remove types:
;;
;; `ctypes-define-type'            Add a type.
;; `ctypes-define-type-in-mode'    Add a type to another major mode.
;; `ctypes-buffer'                 Scan a buffer for types.
;; `ctypes-all-buffer'             Scan all buffer for types.
;; `ctypes-tags'                   Search through all files in a TAGS table.
;; `ctypes-dir'                    Search a directory hierarchy for files.
;; `ctypes-file'                   Search in a file for types.
;; `ctypes-remove-type'            Remove one type.
;; `ctypes-remove-type-in-mode'    Remove one type in another mode.
;; `ctypes-clear-types'            Forget all types.
;; `ctypes-clear-types-all-modes'  Forget all types in all major modes.

;; Edit types:
;;
;; If you would like to view or change the types found you can use the
;; function `ctypes-edit'.  When done press C-c C-c.  Should you like
;; do discard your changes just kill the buffer with C-x k.
;;
;; To edit the types for another major mode use the command
;; `ctypes-edit-types-for-mode'.

;; Saving types:
;;
;; The commands `ctypes-write-file' and `ctypes-read-file' can be used
;; to save your hard-earned collection of types to a file and to
;; retrieve it later.
;;
;; The default file name is stored in the variable `ctypes-file-name'.
;;
;; Note that only one collection of types are managed.  Should you
;; prefer to keep one type file per project, remember to clear the set
;; of known types (using the command `ctypes-clear-types-all-modes')
;; before each new set is generated.

;; At Load:
;;
;; It is possible to automatically add new types, or read specific
;; type files, when Emacs opens a file.
;;
;; By adding a "Local Variables" section to the end of the file
;; containing the variables `ctypes-add-types-at-load' and/or
;; `ctypes-read-files-at-load' this can be accomplished.
;;
;; For example:
;;
;; /*
;;  * Local Variables:
;;  * ctypes-add-types-at-load: ("MyType" "YourType")
;;  * ctypes-read-files-at-load: (".ctypes")
;;  * End:
;;  */

;; The `Auto Parse' mode:
;;
;; This package can automatically search for new types in all visited
;; files.  Activate the minor mode `ctypes-auto-parse-mode' to enable
;; this feature.
;;
;; Add the following line to your startup file to automatically
;; scan all visited files:
;;  (ctypes-auto-parse-mode 1)

;; Example 1:
;;
;; The following setup is for the really lazy person.  The keywords
;; collected during one session will be kept for the next, and all
;; visited files will be parsed in the boldly search for new types.
;; I would recomend using this approach only when you are keeping all
;; your types in one file.
;;
;; (require 'ctypes)
;; (setq ctypes-write-types-at-exit t)
;; (ctypes-read-file nil nil t t)
;; (ctypes-auto-parse-mode 1)

;; Example 2:
;;
;; In this example, ctypes will not be not loaded until either c-mode
;; or c++-mode is activated.  When loaded, ctypes will read the type
;; file "~/.ctypes_std_c" (containing, for example, all types defined
;; in the standard C header files).
;;
;; (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
;;   (require 'ctypes)
;;   (turn-on-font-lock))
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
;; (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
;;
;; (defun my-ctypes-load-hook ()
;;   (ctypes-read-file "~/.ctypes_std_c" nil t t))
;; (add-hook 'ctypes-load-hook 'my-ctypes-load-hook)

;; Reporting bugs:
;;
;;     Out of the last ten bugs you found, how many did you report?
;;
;; When reporting a bug, please:
;;
;; * Send a mail the maintainer of the package, or to the author
;;   if no maintainer exists.
;; * Include the name of the package in the title of the mail, to
;;   simplify for the recipient.
;; * State exactly what you did, what happened, and what you expected
;;   to see when you found the bug.
;; * If possible, include an example that activates the bug.
;; * Should you speculate about the cause of the problem, please
;;   state explicitly that you are guessing.

;; CTypes, the true story:
;;
;; Well, brave reader, are you willing to learn what this package
;; really is capable of?
;;
;; Basically, it is a general purpose parsing package.  The default
;; settings just happened to specify a parser that looks for C
;; typedefs, and that the default action is to add the types found to
;; font-lock.
;;
;; Be redefining the variable `ctypes-mode-descriptor' you can change
;; the behavior totally.  For example, you can use it to search for
;; all occurrences of XX (replace XX with whatever you like) in all
;; files edited in major mode YY (ditto for YY) and to perform ZZ-top
;; whenever a new XX is found.  (However, it might be difficult for
;; Emacs to grow a beard).
;;
;; I will, however, in the document string, write "search for types"
;; when I really mean "Call the parser routine as specified by
;; `ctypes-mode-descriptor'".  Also, I write "Informing font-lock"
;; whenever I mean "Performing the default action as specified in
;; `ctypes-mode-descriptor'".

;; The future:
;;
;; Should this package be included in future versions of Emacs almost
;; all of the font-lock code could be removed.  Also there will be no
;; need to load font-lock to determine which version of
;; ctypes-mode-descriptor to use.

When searching for types in a large number of files it is difficult to
determine which files to parse.  Some types can be missed should too few
file be opened, and the parse process could take much longer than needed
with too many files.

The default behavior, when `ctypes-dir-read-file' is nil, is to look
at the extension of the files found.  Should it match a major mode in
`auto-mode-alist', and the major mode is in `ctypes-mode-descriptor'
we read the file.  Obviously, this approach is fast but it is possible
to miss files.

After the file has been read the real major mode is determined from
the content of the file.  This allows you to specify the real mode
using the -*- mode -*- construction.

Should this variable be t, all non-backup files are read.

Please see the variable `ctypes-dir-backup-files' for a description on
how backup files are treated.

To open only a few extra files, bind this variable to a regexp.

For example, when using the following setting `ctypes-dir' will
open all files ending in `.cplusplus'.
