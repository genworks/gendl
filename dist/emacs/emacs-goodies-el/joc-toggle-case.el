;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Description:
;;
;;  This packages provides a sophisticated (over-engineered?) set of
;;  functions to toggle the case of the character under point, with
;;  which you can emulate vi's ~ function, which I found useful and
;;  miss.  Basically, the vi command (and my version of it) toggles
;;  the case of the current character and then advances to the next
;;  character, allowing successive invocations to progress down the
;;  line.

;; Installation:
;;
;;  Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to your
;;  ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;     (require 'joc-toggle-case)
;;
;;  See below for key-binding suggestions.

;; Usage:
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case'
;;     Toggles the case of the character under point.  If called with
;;     a prefix argument, it toggles that many characters (see
;;     joc-toggle-case-stop-at-eol).  If the prefix is negative, the
;;     case of the character before point is toggled, and if called
;;     with a prefix argument, N characters before point will have
;;     their case toggled (see also joc-toggle-case-backwards).
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case-backwards'
;;     Convenience function to toggle case of character preceeding
;;     point.  This is the same as calling joc-toggle-case with a
;;     negative prefix (and is in fact implemented that way).
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case-by-word'
;;     Similar to joc-toggle-case except that the count (supplied by
;;     the prefix argument) is of the number of words, not letters, to
;;     be toggled.  It will start from point and move to the end of
;;     the first word at a minimum, and then take whole words from
;;     there.  If called with a negative prefix, then from point to
;;     beginning of current word will have their case toggled, going
;;     backwards for N words (see also
;;     joc-toggle-case-by-word-backwards).  Note that the
;;     joc-toggle-case-stop-at-eol setting will be honored.
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case-by-word-backwards'
;;     Convenience function to toggle case by word, backwards.  This
;;     is the same as calling joc-toggle-case-by-word with a
;;     negative prefix (and is in fact implemented that way).
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case-by-word-backwards'
;;     Toggles the case of all characters in the current region.

;; Customization:
;;
;;  M-x `joc-toggle-case-customize' to customize all package options.
;;
;;  The following variables can be customized:
;;
;;  o `joc-toggle-case-stop-at-eol'
;;        Boolean used to determine whether or not the toggle
;;        advancement stops at the end of a line.  Set to `t' it will
;;        stop at the end of the line, set to `nil' it will not (it
;;        will continue on to the next line).  If direction of toggle
;;        is reversed, the semantics of this are reveresed as well
;;        (i.e. does it stop at the beginning of the line).

;; Keybinding examples:
;;
;;  This is what I have -- use it or not as you like.
;;
;;       (global-set-key [(control \`)] 'joc-toggle-case)
;;       (global-set-key [(control ~)] 'joc-toggle-case-backwards)
;;
;;       (global-set-key [(control meta \`)] 'joc-toggle-case-by-word)
;;       (global-set-key [(control meta ~)] 'joc-toggle-case-by-word-backwards)
;;
;;       (define-key joc-F3-keymap [(\`)] 'joc-toggle-case-by-region)
;;
;;   I have a special F3 keymap which this last one is bound to.
;;   Email me if you'd like more details.

;;; To Do:
;;
;;  o Nothing, at the moment.

;;; Comments:
;;
;;  Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are welcome.
;;  Please send them to Joe Casadonte (emacs@northbound-train.com).
;;
;;  This version of joc-toggle-case was developed and tested with NTEmacs
;;  2.7 under Windows NT 4.0 SP6 and Emacs 20.7.1 under Linux (RH7).
;;  Please, let me know if it works with other OS and versions of Emacs.

;;   This version, distributed in the Debian package `emacs-goodies-el',
