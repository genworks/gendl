;;; Commentary:
;; "It's that man Edwards! A dramatic start!"
;;              (Cliff Morgan, BBC TV, Barbarians vs.  New Zealand)

;;; Different Commentary:
;;
;; This uses tar (z)tvf to browse a gzipped tar file without opening the
;; whole thing, in a dired-stylee.  Knocked together in a fit of pique
;; after trying to read the xemacs source tarball in xemacs chewed through
;; all my swapspace one afternoon, and as an exercise in thesis avoidance.

;; The trade off is memory usage vs. speed.  This is very slow on large,
;; compressed tarballs, and each operation is slow individually, but
;; relatively low memory machines (like old 486s running one of the i386
;; unices) don't handle these well with jka-compress and tar-mode either.
;; XEmacs-20.4 was a 13MB gzipped tarball and the similarly packaged linux
;; kernel 2.0.36 was 7MB, so the memory savings can be pretty high too.

;; On small files the saving/price is pretty low, and
;; tar-mode/jka-compress have approximately 10^13 more features, so I'd
;; advise you to go that way.

;;; BUGS:
;;  i) Makes some reasonable but sometimes untrue assumptions: e.g.
;;  No spaces in filenames, unless browse-huge-tar-better-heuristics is non-nil
;;  files ending / in tarballs are directories. (The latter may even be true.)
;;  ii) Should perform sanity-checking for directories in
;;  `browse-huge-tar-copy-file-at-point' before the interactive prompt
;;  (using a wrapper and call-interactively?)
;;  iii) Things like default-directory that should probably get set, don't
;;  get set.
;;  iv)  Plenty of others that are probably just hiding.
;;  Bug reports to <lisp@gwowen.freeserve.co.uk>  Did I say that already?

;;  TODO: Option to make the decompressed file stick around to speed up
;;  repeated access at the cost of disk space.  Where would the clean-up
;;  go?  kill-buffer-hook?
