1. On define-object, the arglist in the mini-buffer does not need to
   contain the "&rest spec-plist"

2. On define-object, the &key args should be in reverse order
   (starting with input-slots computed-slots ...)

3. There's no real need to display "&allow-other-keys"

4. The completion help for the keywords accepted inside an :objects or
   :hidden-objects specification looks really nice and I think just
   this one feature will help the users a lot!

5. Is there a convenient way temporarily to expand the mini-buffer to
   more than one line, to be able to see more info in case it doesn't
   fit in one line of mini-buffer?

6. 

Allegro modern-mode doesn't like:

   (in-package "SWANK") 

changed to 

   (in-package :swank)  ;; should it be #:swank ? 


7. First time compiling gives:

 Warning: While compiling these undefined functions were referenced:
         wrap-test-original from character position 2825 in
           /home/dcooper8/genworks/gendl/emacs/swank/gendl.lisp


   do we need an "eval-when" incantation somewhere? 



8. In :objects specification, after NAME but before :type is ascertained, we see 

  
   (define-object name mixin-list &key (objects ((NAME &key type &allow-other-keys) &rest MORE-OBJECTS)) &allow-other-keys)

  
   a. The "NAME" and "MORE-OBJECTS" in uppercase appears a bit shocking in modern-mode. Do they need to be in uppercase? 

   b. Do we need the "&allow-other-keys" in this situation?
