
1. Why do some slots and the tree get unevaluated when doing a refresh and/or update?

2. Make inspector values which are GDL objects be selectable.

3. Make slot values which are sequences be selectable, and replace
   with scrolling area with elements from sequence.

4. Make each area easily resizeable.

5. Make the areas reconfigurable/rearrangeable.

6. In general: add professional design look to ta2.

7. Trap errors in geometry display-list.

8. Wrap names in inspector column (shrink its width somehow).

9. Handle updates after an object is removed from the tree.

  to replicate:

  1. add a new child to the tree
  2. update and draw the leaves
  3. remove the object in the code
  4. update the ta2/tatu browser



10. More robust error message for non-expanding nodes in tree, which
    work in IE.

11. Add the measure-distance capability in a friendly way.
