12. Add horizontal scroll bar to Tree.

5.  Make the areas reconfigurable/rearrangeable.

7.  Trap errors in geometry display-list.



9. Handle updates after an object is removed from the tree.

  to replicate:

  1. add a new child to the tree
  2. update and draw the leaves
  3. remove the object in the code
  4. update the ta2/tatu browser


10. More robust error message for non-expanding nodes in tree, which
    work in IE.


11. Add the measure-distance capability in a friendly way.



;; ========= Resolved or on hold  =================================


1. Why do some slots and the tree get unevaluated when doing a refresh and/or update?

2. Make inspector values which are GDL objects be selectable.

3. Make slot values which are sequences be selectable, and replace
   with scrolling area with elements from sequence.

4. Make each area easily resizeable.

6. In general: add professional design look to ta2.

8. Wrap names in inspector column (shrink its width somehow).
