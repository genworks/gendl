Release Notes for Build Stamp 2012080300 w.r.t. previous 2012080300
===================================================================

o FIXED glisp:set-gs-path to look in level up for gpl/ directory as
  well, since Slime etc. work with it there now.

o REMOVED :mysql client support -- this will be included only in
  special releases. The normal release will not include it, to
  simplify installation by avoiding the need for additional .dll's to
  be installed.





Release Notes for Build Stamp 2012080200 w.r.t. previous 2012052101
===================================================================

 o ADDED billboard support for x3d/x3dom. Use :billboard
   :billboard-vector keyword in :display-controls.

 o ADDED partial text-line support for x3d, added anchor support for
   x3d and x3dom. Bind gdl:*onclick-function* dynamically around call
   to (with-format (x3d ...)) to apply an onclick function to the
   anchor.

 o ADDED STEP assembly output with names and colors. 

   Produce assembly with 

     (with-format (step <path>.stp :assembly? t) (write-the ...))
 
   Still missing: nested coordinate system transforms at
   subassemblies.

 o ADDED sections to documentation/training/g102-tud/

 o ADDED ability to have gpl/ directory (with gnu-emacs and
   ghostscript) as a sibling directory of Gendl application directory,
   in addition to the old style of having it be within the Gendl
   directory.

 o ADDED M-x gendl as startup equivalent to M-x slime

 o ADDED M-x quit-gendl as shutdown equivalent to M-x slime-quit-lisp

 o ADDED ability to use .gdl or .gendl as file extension, instead of
   .lisp. This will work with Slime-mode, cl-lite, and asdf/quicklisp.

 o ADDED surf:spiral-curve primitive (documented).

 o ADDED surf:non-rational-curve primitive (documented). 

    Note that the driver for this was the fact that it appears that
    lofted-surface will not work properly with a mixture of rational
    and non-rational profile curves, so this primitive provides a
    workaround. We will be confirming that this is indeed a limitation
    of lofted-surface. 

 o ADDED Allegro :mysql client module to this release. Requires
   installation of OpenSSL libraries on windows. 

 o FIXED bug with nested orientations in x3d lens. 

 o FIXED weight issues with rational b-spline-curve, b-spline-surface,
   boxed-curve, boxed-surface.

 o FIXED x3d display of left-handed coordinate systems (equivalent to
   patch-003 in 2012052101)

 o FIXED base-ajax-sheet to respect the specified doc-type-string. 

 

Known Bugs:
===========

 approximated-curve is still not functional in the SMLib included with
 this release. This should be resolved in the next release which has
 an SMLib update.


Other Notes:
============

 smlib::assembly-import is still available on experimental basis, not
 documented. Accepts file-name as the main input-slot. Will
 automatically choose the reader to use (step or iges) based on file
 extension (.stp, .step, .igs, or .iges).


See the README.txt for important installation information.
