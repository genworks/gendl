Release Notes for Build Stamp 2012080300 w.r.t. previous 2012080300
===================================================================

o FIXED glisp:set-gs-path to look in level up for gpl/ directory as
  well, since Slime etc. work with it there now.

o REMOVED :mysql client support -- this will be included only in
  special releases. The normal release will not include it, to
  simplify installation by avoiding the need for additional .dll's to
  be installed.
