(defun cl-lite (pathname &rest args)
  "
   Traverses pathname in an alphabetical depth-first order, compiling
   and loading any lisp files found in source/ subdirectories. A lisp
   source file will only be compiled if it is newer than the
   corresponding compiled fasl binary file, or if the corresponding
   compiled fasl binary file does not exist. A bin/source/ will be
   created, as a sibling to each source/ subdirectory, to contain the
   compiled fasl files.

   If the :create-fasl? keyword argument is specified as non-nil, a
   concatenated fasl file, named after the last directory component of
   pathname, will be created in the (glisp:temporary-directory). 

   [Note: this new documentation still needs proper formatting]

   If the :create-asd-file? keyword argument is specified as non-nil,
   a .asd file suitable for use with ASDF will be emitted into the
   directory indicated by the pathname argument. Note that
   ASDF (Another System Definition Utility), possibly with help of
   Quicklisp, is (as of 2013-03-12) the recommended way for handling
   Common Lisp system modules. As of version 2.31.9, ASDF is also
   capable of generating fasl \"bundle\" files as with
   the :create-fasl? argument to cl-lite.

   For the :author, :version, and :license arguments in the generated
   .asd file, the files author.isc, version.isc, and license.isc,
   respectively, are consulted, if they exist. They are searched for
   first in the codebase toplevel directory (the pathname argument to
   this function), then in the (user-homedir-pathname). The version
   defaults to the current ISO-8601 date without dashes,
   e.g. \"20130312\".

   Please see the Genworks Documentation for an overview of Quicklisp
   and ASDF, and see the Quicklisp and ASDF project documentation for
   detailed information. The source code for Quicklisp and ASDF should
   also be included with your Gendl distribution, and these are
   typically loaded by default into the development environment.

   For additional inputs to the cl-lite function, please see
codebase-directory-node object for additional inputs (which can be
given as keyword args to this function)."
