                  :description "This object can be used to represent a single HTML form control. It captures the 
initial default value, some display information such as the label, and all the standard HTML tag attributes
for the tag e.g. INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA. GWL will process the data types according to specific rules,
and validate the typed value according to other default rules. A custom validation-function can also 
be provided by user code. 

Sequences of these objects (with :size, :indices, :matrix, and :radial) are supported.

This facility and its documentation is expected to undergo significant and frequent upgrades in the remainder of GDL 1573 and upcoming 1575.

Current to-do list:

<ol>

<li>
Currently this works with normal HTTP form submission and full page reloading. 
We intend to make it work with AJAX and surgical page update as well.

<li>
We intend to provide inputs for all the standard tag attributes for the accompanying LABEL tag for the form control.

<li>
Additional form control elements to be included, to cover all types of form elements specified in current HTML standard from

    http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.2.1

    <ul>
      <li>button-form-control: submit buttons, reset buttons, push buttons.
      <li>checkbox-form-control: checkboxes, radio buttons (multiple of these must be able to have same name)
      <li>menu-form-control: select, along with optgroup and option.
      <li>text-form-control: single-line text input (including masked passwords) and multi-line (TEXTAREA) text input.
      <li>file-form-control: file select for submittal with a form.
      <li>hidden-form-control: input of type hidden.
      <li>object-form-control: (not sure how this is supposed to work yet).
    </ul>
</ol>


Also, we have to study and clarify the issue of under what conditions values can possibly take on nil values, 
and what constitutes a required field as opposed to a non-validated field, and whether a blank string on a text
input should be represented as a nil value or as an empty string.

Note that checkbox-form-control and menu-form-control currently get automatically included in the possible-nils.
