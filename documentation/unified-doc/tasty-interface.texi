@section The Tasty Interface
@i{Tasty}@footnote{Tasty is a tortured acronym of acronyms - it stands
for TAtu (ta2) with STYle (sheets), or Testing And tracking utility
with STYle.} is a web based testing and tracking utility. Note that
Tasty is designed for developers of GenDL applications --- it is not
intended as an end-user application interface (see the [FLAG --
gdlAjax section] for the recommended steps to create end-user
interfaces).

Tasty allows you to visualize and inspect any object defined in GenDL,
which mixes at least @b{base-object} into its root-level
part@footnote{base-object is the core mixin for all geometric objects
and gives them a coordinate system, length, width, and height. This
restriction in tasty will be removed in a future GenDL release so you
will be able to instantiate non-geometric root-level objects in tasty
as well, for example to inspect objects which generate a web page but
no geometry.} To access Tasty, point your web browser to the URL:

@sp 1
@cartouche 
@smallexample   
@b{http://<host>:<port>/tasty}

@i{!!!by default this URL is:}

@b{http://localhost:9000/tasty}
@end smallexample
@end cartouche 
@sp 1

This will bring up the start-up page (see figure 6). To access a
specific object you must specify the class package and the object
type, separated by a colon (``:'') or a double-colon (``::'') in case
the symbol naming the type is not exported from the package. For
example, for the previous presented shock-absorber model, the
specification will be: @b{shock-absorber:assembly}, or by using the
package nickname @b{shock} or @b{picasso} the specification would be
@b{shock:assembly} or @b{picasso:assembly}.
@sp 1
@center @image{images/tasty-start,,3.7in  }
@center Figure 6: Tasty start up.


Note that if the @b{assembly} symbol had not been exported from the
@b{:shock-absorber} package, then a double-colon would have been
needed: @b{shock-absorber::assembly}@footnote{use of a double-colon
indicates dubious coding practice, because it means that the code in
quesion is accessing the ``internals'' or ``guts'' of another package,
which may not have been the intent of that other package's designer.}.

 
After you specify the class package and the object type and press the
``browse'' button, the browser will bring up the utility interface
with an instance of the specified type (see figure 7).

The utility interface by default is composed of three toolbars and
three view frames (tree frame, inspector frame and viewport frame
``graphical view port'').

@subsection The Toolbars

The first toolbar consists of two ``tabs'' which allow the user to
select between the display of the application itself or the GenDL
reference documentation.

The second toolbar is designed to select various ``click modes'' for
objects and graphical viewing, and to customize the interface in other
ways. It hosts five menus: edit, tree, view, windows and
help@footnote{A File menu will be added in a future release, to
facilitate saving and restoring of instance ``snapshots'' -- at
present, this can be done programmatically.}.

@b{The edit and window menu} allows the user to customize the
interface in various ways.

@b{The tree menu} allows the user to customize the ``click mode'' of
the mouse (or ``tap mode'' for other pointing device) for objects in
any of the tree, inspector, or viewport frames. The behavior follows
the @b{select-and-match} paradigm -- you first @b{select} a mode of
operation with one of the buttons or menu items, then @b{match} that
mode to any object in the tree frame or inspector frame by
left-clicking (or tapping). These modes are as follows:

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Graphical modes>>}

@noindent
Add Node (AN) --- Add Node in graphics view port 

@noindent
Add Leaves (AL) --- Add Leaves in graphics view port

@noindent
Add Leaves indiv. (AL*) --- Add Leaves individually (so they can be deleted individually).

@noindent
Draw Node (DN) --- Draw Node in graphics view port (replacing any existing).

@noindent
Draw Leaves (DL) --- Draw Leaves in graphics view port (replacing any existing).

@noindent
Clear Leaves (DL) --- Delete Leaves

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Inspect & debug modes>>}

@noindent
Inspect object (I) --- Inspect (make the inspector frame to show the selected object).

@noindent
Set self to Object (B) --- Break on selected object.

@noindent
Set Root to Object (SR) --- Set displayed root in Tasty tree to selected object.

@noindent
Up Root (UR!) --- Set displayed root in Tasty tree up one level (this is grayed out if already on root).

@noindent
Reset Root (RR!) --- Reset displayed root in Tasty to to the true root of the tree (this is grayed out if already on root).

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Tree frame navigation modes>>}

@noindent
Expand to Leaves (L) --- Nodes expand to their deepest leaves when clicked. 

@noindent
Expand to Children (C) --- Nodes expand to their direct children when clicked. 

@noindent
Auto Close (A) --- When any node is clicked to expand, all other nodes close automatically.

@noindent
Remember State (R) --- Nodes expand to their previously expanded state when clicked. 

@sp 1
@b{The view menu} allows the user to customize the graphics view port modes. These modes are as follows: 

@noindent
@b{<<Viewport Actions>>}

@noindent
Fit to Window! --- Fits to the graphics view port size the displayed objects (use after a Zoom).

@noindent
Clear View! (CL!)--- Clear all the objects displayed in the graphics view port.

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Image Format>>}

@noindent
PNG --- Sets the displayed format in the graphics view port to PNG (raster image with 
        isoparametric curves for surfaces and brep faces).

@noindent
JPEG --- Sets the displayed format in the graphics view port to JPEG
         (raster image with isoparametric curves for surfaces and brep faces).

@noindent
VRML/X3D --- Sets the displayed format in the graphics view port to
             VRML with default lighting and viewpoint (these can be changed
             programmatically).

@noindent  
SVG/VML --- Sets the displayed format in the graphics view port to SVG/VML@footnote{For complex objects
            with many display curves, SVG/VML can overwhelm the JavaScript engine in the web browser. Use
            PNG for these cases.} (vector graphics image with isoparametric curves for surfaces 
            and brep faces).

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Click Modes>>}

@noindent
Zoom in --- Sets the mouse left-click in the graphics view port to zoom in. 

@noindent
Zoom out --- Sets the mouse left-click in the graphics view port to zoom out. 

@noindent
Measure distance --- Calculates the distance between two selected points from the graphics view port.

@noindent
Get coordinates --- Displays the coordinates of the selected point from the graphics view port.

@noindent
Select Object --- Allows the user to select an object from the
                  graphics view port (currently works for displayed curves and in
                  SVG/VML mode only).

@sp 1
@noindent
@b{<<Perspective>>}

@noindent
Trimetric --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to trimetric.

@noindent
Front --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Front (-Y axis).

@noindent
Rear --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Rear (+Y axis).

@noindent
Left --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Left (-X axis).

@noindent
Right --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Right (+X axis).

@noindent
Top --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Top (+Z axis).

@noindent
Bottom --- Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics view port to Bottom (-Z axis).

@b{Third toolbar} hosts the most frequently used buttons. This buttons have tooltips which will 
pop up when you hover the mouse over them. However, these buttons are found in the second 
toolbar too, except line thickness and color buttons. The line thickness and color buttons@footnote{the 
design of the line thickness and color buttons is being refined and may appear different in your 
installation.} 
expand and contract when clicked on and allows the user to select a desired line thickness 
and color for the objects displayed in the graphics view port.

@subsection View Frames

@b{The tree frame} is a hierarchical representation of your defined object. For example for 
the  shock-absorber @b{assembly} this will be as depicted 
in figure 8.
@sp 1
@center @image{images/tree-shock-absorber,,3.2in  }
@center Figure 8: Tasty shock-absorber tree.
@sp 1

To draw the graphics (geometry) for the shock-absorber leaf-level
objects, you can select the ``Add Leaves (AL)'' item from the Tree
menu, then click the desired leaf to be displayed from the tree or
select the @i{rapid} button from third toolbar which is symbolized by
a pencil @image{images/tbar_pen,,0.2in}. Because this operation (draw
leaves) is frequently used, the tree leaves has this operation
directly available as a tooltip, which will pop up when you hover the
mouse over them.  To perform this operation on the fly, you simply
have to click the pencil icon; it does not require a second click on
the leaf in the tre (see figure 8).

The ``on the fly'' feature is available also for ``inspect
object''(second icon when you hover the mouse over a leaf) and
``highlight object'' (third icon when you hover the mouse over a
leaf). For safety reasons highlight object requires a second click on
the leaf (a confirmation that the user wants to remove that leaf from
the graphics view port).

@b{The inspector frame} allows the user to inspect (and in some cases
modify) object instance being inspected.  Following are some examples
of how the inspector frame may be used.

To prepare for the first example, we will modify the assembly
definition by adding a settable @b{input-slot} for the piston radius.
In GenDL, the @b{:input-slots} are made up of a list, each of whose
elements is either a symbol (for required inputs) or a list expression
beginning with a symbol (for optional inputs). In either case, the
symbol represents a value which can be supplied either:

@b{(a)} into the toplevel object of an object hierarchy, when the object is
        instanted, or

@b{(b)} into a child object, using a @b{:objects} specification by
        definition in the parent.

Inputs are specified in the definition either as a symbol by itself
(for required inputs), or as an expression whose @b{first} is a symbol
and whose @b{second} is an expression which returns a value which will
be the default value for the input slot.

Optionally, additional keywords can be supplied: 

@itemize

@item the keyword @b{:defaulting}, which indicates that if a slot by this name is
contained in any ancestor object's list of
:trickle-down-slots@footnote{trickle-down slots will be introduced
later}, the value from the ancestor will take precedence over the
local default expression.

@item The keyword @b{:settable}, which indiates that the default value of 
this slot can be ``bashed,'' or overridden, at runtime after the
object has been instantiated, using the special object function
@b{set-slot!}@footnote{Any other slots depending on settable slots (directly or
indirectly) will become unbound when the @b{:set-slot!} function is
called to change the slot's value, and these will be recomputed the
next time they are demanded.}.

@end itemize

For this example, we will supply piston-radius as an input symbol with
a default expression and with the optional keyword @b{:settable}. We
will also pass the piston-radius down into the child @b{piston}
object, rather than using a hard-coded value of 12 as previously. The
new assembly definition is now:

In this new version ``V0.1'' of the assembly, the piston radius is a
settable slot, and its value can be modified (i.e. ``bashed'') as
desired, either programmatically from the command-line, in an end-user
application, or from @b{Tasty}.

@sp 1

@center @image{images/tasty-s-slots,,3.2in}
@center Figure 10: Tasty settable slots.
@sp 1

To modify the value in Tasty: select ``Inspect'' mode from the Tree
menu, then select the root of the @b{assembly} tree to set the
inspector on that object (see figure 9). Once the inspector is set to
this object, it is possible to expand its settable slots by clicking
on the ``Show Settables!'' link. (use the ``X'' link to collapse the
settable slots view). When the settable slots area is open the user
may set the values as desired by inputting the new value and pressing
the OK button (see figure 10).

As it can be observed from Figure 10, there is no dependency between
the piston radius and the rest of the shock-absorber objects
(components). If such a dependency is desired, the definition has to
be modified to include it. For the moment the piston radius will be
considered as the leading parameter, the rod radius constant and the
piston Y position will be added as a settable input slot. In addition
to this dimensional dependency, two computed slots will be added to the
previous code in order to compute the volume A and B (see figure 5) as
follows:

The dimensional dependency is a straight forward operation similar to
the @b{piston-radius} being passed in for the @b{piston} @b{radius} in
v0.1. The only difference in this case is that, for some of the
objects, a coefficient was added to account for a wall thickness
(e.g. 0.8) which is multiplied with the @b{piston-radius}.

Regarding the volume A and B, these are computed in such a manner to
account for any geometry variation, including relative movement of the
piston and floating-piston.  While the Lisp expression may not be
immediately obvious, in practice it is easy to build up such an
expression incrementally at the prompt level until a valid expression
is obtained. See example below:

Assuming that the @b{assembly version V0.2} is compiled and loaded,
you can update @b{Tasty} by clicking the ``update'' button
@image{images/tbar_update,,0.2in}.To start implementing the volume-a
sequentially (although the volume-a and volume-b is already
implemented in V0.2, this is a good exercise to go through), select
the click mode to ``break'' @image{images/tbar_break,,0.2in} and ``set
self'' to the @b{shock-absorber:assembly} by clicking the assembly
root. This will allow you to interact directly with the shock-absorber
assembly at the prompt level where you can type the following:

Note that the implementation of @b{volume-a} and @b{volume-b} in the
shock-absorber assembly are non-settable @b{computed-slots}. This 
means that they are, in fact, messages of the object which are strictly computed based
on their default expression.

Computed-slots will only be computed when called (``demanded''), then
the resultant values will be cached (memorized)in memory. Only if
another slot on which they depend becomes modified will they become
unbound, then their values will be recomputed from their expressions
when demanded next time.

At prompt you can ask for @b{volume-a} and @b{volume-b} value by typing:

@sp 1

@sp 1

Adding a relative movement to the piston by using the slot
@b{piston-y-position}, will implicitly alter the dimensional
connection in the Y direction between the piston and the rod - see
figure 12. To account for this, a dimensional dependency must be added
in the y direction. The best practice for this particular case is to
define a piston assembly as a separate object definition (and in a
separate file --- piston-assembly.lisp) which will contain both the
definition of piston/rod and the dimensional dependency as presented
below:

In this version of the assembly, @b{:pass-down} was used to pass the
@b{piston-radius}, @b{piston-y-position}, @b{piston-length}, and
@b{rot-length} into the child piston-assembly.  @b{:pass-down} is a
shorthand way of passing inputs into a child object where the
input-slots in the child definition have the same names as the
messages in the parent.  The following child specification would be
exactly equivalent (but more verbose) to the above @b{:pass-down}
clause:

Basically, the shock-absorber assembly is fully constrained in the
above example, except for the floating piston position.  In a real
application, the piston and floating piston relative movement in the Y
direction is determined by the absorbed energy at shock. However, we
will not detail the full shock absorber physics in this
manual. Instead, we will provide an ``ideal case'' example by adding a
function to determine the equilibrium between the two pistons when
loaded. The following ideal case will be considered:

The shock-absorber volume-a is filled with an ideal gas and
experiences an isothermal transformation T=const, pV=const.
In volume-b a incompressible liquid is used. Based on this assumptions the 
volume-a variation at load can be defined as follows:

@tex
$ \ pV = \ nRT = \ ct.$

$ \ p_{A} V_{A} = \ p_{A0} V_{A0} $

@end tex

@sp 1
If :
@sp 1

@tex
$ p_A > 1.101325 \ X \ 10^5  \ N/m^2 $
@end tex

@sp 1
Then:
@sp 1
@tex

$ V_{A0} = \left (p_A V_A
          \over \ p_A + \left (m g
              \over \ 2 \pi R \right) \right) $

$ Y^*_0 = Y^* - \left (1
              \over \ 2 \pi R \right) 
              (V_A - V_{A0})  $
         
@end tex

Based on this, a function can be defined as follows, which will
automatically compute the new piston y position when loaded:
