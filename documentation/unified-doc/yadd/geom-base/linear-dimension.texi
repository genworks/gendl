 @item 3x3 Matrix of Double-Float Numbers. Indicates the absolute Rotation Matrix used to create 
the coordinate system of this object. This matrix is given in absolute terms (i.e. with 
respect to the root's orientation), and is generally created with the alignment function. 
It should be an @i{orthonormal}  matrix, meaning each row is a vector with a magnitude 
of one (1.0).


@end itemize

     Defaults to 3.

@end itemize
