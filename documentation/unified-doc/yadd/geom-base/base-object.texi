@subsubsection Base-object

@b{Description}

Base-Object is a superclass of most of GDL's geometric primitives. It 
provides an imaginary geometric reference box with a length, width, height, center, 
and orientation.

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:bounding-box}

@itemize {}

 @item List of two 3D points. The left front bottom and right rear top corners, in global coordinates,
of the rectangular volume bounding the tree of geometric objects rooted at this object.

@end itemize

@b{:image-file}

@itemize {}

 @item Pathname or string. Points to a pre-existing image file to be displayed instead of actual geometry for this object. Defaults to nil

@end itemize

@b{:local-box}

@itemize {}

 @item List of two 3D points. The left front bottom and right rear top corners, in global coordinates,
of the rectangular volume bounding this geometric object.

@end itemize

@b{:obliqueness}

@itemize {}

 @item 3x3 Orthonormal Matrix of Double-Float Numbers. This is synonymous with the orientation.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Defaulted-input-slots}

@b{:center}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Point. Indicates in global coordinates where the center of the reference 
box of this object should be located.

@end itemize

@b{:display-controls}

@itemize {}

 @item Plist. May contain keywords and values indicating display characteristics for
 this object. The following keywords are recognized currently:
 
 @itemize {} 
 @item :color
 @itemize @minus  color keyword from the *color-table* parameter, or an HTML-style hexidecimal
RGB string value, e.g. "#FFFFFF" for pure white. Defaults to :black.
@end itemize 


 @item :line-thickness
  @itemize @minus  an integer, defaulting to 1, indicating relative line thickness for wireframe
representations of this object.
@end itemize 


 @item :dash-pattern
 @itemize @minus (currently PDF/PNG/JPEG only). This is a list of two or three numbers which indicate the length,
 in pixels, of the dashes and blank spaces in a dashed line. The optional third number
 indicates how far into the line or curve to start the dash pattern.
@end itemize 



@end itemize 



@end itemize

@b{:height}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Z-axis dimension of the reference box. Defaults to zero.

@end itemize

@b{:length}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Y-axis dimension of the reference box. Defaults to zero.

@end itemize

@b{:orientation}

@itemize {}

 @item 3x3 Matrix of Double-Float Numbers. Indicates the absolute Rotation Matrix used to create 
the coordinate system of this object. This matrix is given in absolute terms (i.e. with 
respect to the root's orientation), and is generally created with the alignment function. 
It should be an @i{orthonormal}  matrix, meaning each row is a vector with a magnitude 
of one (1.0).


@end itemize

@b{:width}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. X-axis dimension of the reference box. Defaults to zero.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Computed-slots}

@b{:color-decimal}

@itemize {}

 @item Vector of three real numbers. The RBG color of this object specified in :display-controls. 
Defaults to the foreground color specified in *colors-default*. This message should not normally be overridden in user application code.

@end itemize

@b{:local-center}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Point. The center of this object, from the perspective of the parent. Starting
from the parent's center and using the parent's orientation, this is the relative center
of this object.


@end itemize

@b{:local-orientation}

@itemize {}

 @item 3x3 Matrix of Double-Float Numbers. Indicates the local Rotation Matrix used 
to create the coordinate system of this object. This is the ``local'' 
orientation with respect to the parent. Multiplying the parent's orientation 
with this matrix will always result in the absolute orientation for this part.

 :note An orientation of NIL indicates the 3x3 identity matrix.



@end itemize

@noindent @b{Hidden-objects}

@b{:bounding-bbox}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL object of type Box. A box representing the bounding-box.

@end itemize

@b{:local-bbox}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL object of type Box. A box representing the local-box.

@end itemize
