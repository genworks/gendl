@subsubsection Base-drawing

@b{Description}

Generic container object for displaying one or more scaled
transformed views of geometric or text-based entities. The contained views are generally 
of type @i{base-view}. In a GWL application-mixin, you can include one 
object of this type in the ui-display-list-leaves.

For the PDF output-format, you can also use the cad-output output-function to write the 
drawing as a PDF document. 

Since base-drawing is inherently a 2D object, only the top view (getf *standard-views* :top) 
makes sense for viewing it.

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Z-axis dimension of the reference box. Defaults to zero.

@b{:length}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Y-axis dimension of the reference box. Defaults to zero.

@end itemize

@b{:page-length}

@itemize {}

 @item Number in PDF Points. Front-to-back (or top-to-bottom) length of the paper being represented 
by this drawing. The default is (* 11 72) points, or 11 inches, corresponding to US standard 
letter-size paper.

@end itemize

@b{:page-width}

@itemize {}

 @item Number in PDF Points. Left-to-right width of the paper being represented by this drawing. 
The default is (* 8.5 72) points, or 8.5 inches, corresponding to US standard letter-size paper.
