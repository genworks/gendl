@subsubsection Global-polygon-projection

@b{Description}

A polygon ``extruded'' for a given distance along a single vector.
For planar polygons, the projection vector must not be orthogonal to the normal of the plane of
the polygon. The vertices and projection-vector are given in the global coordinate system, so
the local center and orientation do not affect the positioning or orientation of this part.

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:projection-depth}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. The resultant distance from the two end faces of the extrusion.

@end itemize

@b{:vertex-list}

@itemize {}

 @item List of 3D points. The vertex list making up the polyline, same as the input for global-polyline.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:offset}

@itemize {}

 @item The direction of extrusion with respect to the vertices in vertex-list and the projection-vector:
 @itemize 
 @item :up Indicates to start from current location of vertices and move in the direction of 
the projection-vector.
 @item :down Indicates to start from current location of vertices and move in the direction opposite
the projection-vector.
 @item :center Indicates to start from current location of vertices and move in the direction of 
the projection-vector @i{and}  opposite the projection-vector, going half the projection-depth in
each direction.

@end itemize 



@end itemize

@b{:projection-vector}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Vector. Indicates the straight path along which the extrusion should occur.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Computed-slots}

@b{:bounding-box}

@itemize {}

 @item List of two 3D points. The left front bottom and right rear top corners, in global coordinates,
of the rectangular volume bounding the tree of geometric objects rooted at this object.

@end itemize
