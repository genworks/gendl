@subsubsection Point

@b{Description}

Visual representation of a point as a small view-independent crosshair. This means
the crosshair will always appear in a ``top'' view regardless of the current view transform. The crosshair will
not scale along with any zoom state unless the @i{scale?} optional input-slot is non-NIL. The default
color for the crosshairs is a light grey (:grey-light-very in the *color-table*).

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:crosshair-length}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance from center to end of crosshairs used to show the point. Default value is 3.

@end itemize

@b{:radius}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance from center to any point on the sphere.

@end itemize

@b{:scaled?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. Indicates whether the crosshairs drawn to represent the point are scaled along with
any zoom factor applied to the display, or are fixed with respect to drawing space. The default is NIL,
meaning the crosshairs will remain the same size regardless of zoom state.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Computed-slots}

@b{:bounding-box}

@itemize {}

 @item List of two 3D points. The left front bottom and right rear top corners, in global coordinates,
of the rectangular volume bounding the tree of geometric objects rooted at this object.
