@subsubsection Node-mixin

@b{Description}

Generates a default GWL user interface with a model-inputs area,
user-navigable tree with child applications, graphics view with controls, and rule display. 

Child objects should be of type @i{node-mixin} or @i{application-mixin}. Child hidden-objects
may be of any type.

The @i{ui-display-list-objects} is appended up automatically from those of the children.

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:default-tree-depth}

@itemize {}

 @item Integer. Determines how many descendant levels to show in the tree initially. Default is 1.

@end itemize

@b{:node-ui-display-list-objects}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL object list. Appends additional objects to the automatically-appended ui-display-list-objects 
from the children.

@end itemize



@noindent @b{Computed-slots}

@b{:ui-display-list-leaves}

@itemize {}

 @item List of GDL objects. This should be overridden with a list of objects of your choice. These objects (not their leaves,
but these actual nodes) will be scaled to fit and displayed in the graphics area. Defaults to NIL.

@end itemize

@b{:ui-display-list-objects}

@itemize {}

 @item List of GDL object roots. The leaves of these objects will be 
displayed in the graphics. Defaults to the appended result of children's 
ui-display-list-objects.

@end itemize
