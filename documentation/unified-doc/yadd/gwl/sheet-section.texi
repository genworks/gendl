@subsubsection Sheet-section

@b{Description}

Basic mixin to support an object 
representing a section of an HTML sheet (i.e. web page). Currently 
this simply mixes in skeleton-ui-element, and the functionality is not 
extended. Sheet-section is also mixed into base-html-sheet, so it and 
any of its subclasses will be considered as sheet-sections if they 
are the child of a base-ajax-sheet.
