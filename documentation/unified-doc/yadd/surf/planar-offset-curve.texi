@subsubsection Planar-offset-curve

@b{Description}

Creates a curve which is the result of offsetting a curve by its normals along a plane.

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curve-in}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve. The curve to be offset

@end itemize

@b{:distance}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. The left-hand distance to offset with respect to curve direction. To get the opposite 
 direction, you can either negate this number or reverse the plane-normal.

@end itemize

@b{:plane-normal}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Vector. The normal for the plane

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:tolerance}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. The tolerance for approximating the resulting offset curve. 
Defaults to *3d-approximation-tolerance-default*.
