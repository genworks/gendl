@subsubsection Ruled-surface

@b{Description}

Creates a surface between two NURBS curves.:

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curve-1}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve object. First boundary of the ruled surface.

@end itemize

@b{:curve-2}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve object. Second boundary of the ruled surface.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:direction}

@itemize {}

 @item Keyword symbol, either :u or :v. The direction of parameterization of the surface between the two curves.

@end itemize
