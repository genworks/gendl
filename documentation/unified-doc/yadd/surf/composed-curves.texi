@subsubsection Composed-curves

@b{Description}

Creates multiple NURBS curves by composing a list (ordered or unordered) NURBS curves. 
If the result is expected to be a single curve, you may wish to use @i{composed-curve} instead.

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curves-in}

@itemize {}

 @item List of GDL curve objects. These are the curves to be composed into a single curve.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:coincident-point-tolerance}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance two curve endpoints can be apart and be considered coincident, the composite will be built
without doing anything to the endpoints. Default is 0.01. Note: This input-slot must be non-zero.

@end itemize

@b{:distance-to-create-line}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance two curve endpoints can be apart and have a linear curve segment automatically added between the points. Default is 0.1.

@end itemize



@noindent @b{Quantified-objects}

@b{:curves}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL Curve Objects. The curves resulting from composition.

@end itemize
