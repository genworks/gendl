@subsubsection Linear-curve

@b{Description}

A GDL NURBS Curve representing a straight line segment. The inputs are the same as
for l-line, namely @i{start} and @i{end} (3d points).



@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:end}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Point. The end point of the line, in global coordinates.

@end itemize

@b{:start}

@itemize {}

 @item 3D Point. The start point of the line, in global coordinates.

@end itemize
