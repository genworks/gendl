@subsubsection Step-reader

@b{Description}

This object will reflect the contents of a STEP file containing
points, curves, surfaces, and/or trimmed surfaces as sequences of GDL objects. Currently all
surfaces are treated as trimmed, where actual untrimmed surfaces have their natural outer 
boundaries as the result-island, i.e. no standalone surfaces will be produced by this part. 

This is a default option in the HarmonyWare STEP Translator which will be exposed in GDL
in a future release.

The HarmonyWare reader creates a log file in a temporary directory. The location of this log
file is printed on the console during the reading operation. Currently this log file is
not automatically deleted, and its name is determined by the system.



@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:file-name}

@itemize {}

 @item String or pathname. The location of the STEP file to be read.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:group-trimmed-surfaces-into-brep?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. If true, group all trimmed surfaces in the file into one B-rep.  
If some trimmed surfaces are blanked, they are grouped into a second, blanked B-rep. Default is nil.

@end itemize

@b{:make-all-surfaces-trimmed?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. If true, treat all untrimmed surfaces in the file as if they are trimmed surfaces with 
the natural outer boundary of the surface as the trimming loop.  If used, no standalone IwSurface surface objects 
will ever be returned by the reader.  Default is nil.

@end itemize

@b{:make-single-brep?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. If true, group all trimmed surfaces and B-reps in the file into one B-rep.  
If some trimmed surfaces or B-reps are blanked, they are grouped into a second, blanked B-rep. Default is nil.

@end itemize

@b{:sew-brep-faces?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. Indicates whether each resulting brep should have its faces sewn together. Default is (the make-single-brep?).

@end itemize



@noindent @b{Quantified-objects}

@b{:breps}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL brep objects. The breps and trimmed surfaces (represented as breps) found in the STEP file.

@end itemize

@b{:curves}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL curve objects. The curves found in the STEP file.

@end itemize

@b{:points}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL point objects. The points found in the STEP file.

@end itemize

@b{:surfaces}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL surface objects. The untrimmed ``standalone'' surfaces found in the STEP file.

@end itemize
