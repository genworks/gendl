@subsubsection Merged-solid

@b{Description}

Given two brep solids or a brep solid and an open face represented as a brep,
performs a merge operation. Optionally (with make-manifold? t) makes the result manifold by trimming 
and throwing away extra pieces of faces and edges.

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:make-manifold?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. Indicates whether the resulting brep should be made into a manifold brep, with one or more regions.

@end itemize

@b{:sew-and-orient?}

@itemize {}

 @item Boolean. Indicates whether we should try to sew and orient the resulting brep. Usually a good idea 
and this is defaulted to t, except for merged-solid where we default this to nil.
