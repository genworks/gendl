@subsubsection Decomposed-curves

@b{Description}

Given an input curve, creates a sequence of curve segments that do not contain 
knots with degree-fold mutiplicity, i.e. each piece is at least C^ continuous.

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curve-in}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve. Curve (presumably multi-segment) to be decomposed.

@end itemize





@noindent @b{Quantified-objects}

@b{:curves}

@itemize {}

 @item Sequence of GDL curve objects. The resulting segment curves after decomposition.
