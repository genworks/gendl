@subsubsection Dropped-curve

@b{Description}

Creates a 3D curve which is the @i{curve-in} dropped normally to the @i{surface.}.
The resulting 3D curve contains a uv-curve which is typically useful for trimming.


NOTE: Change from 1577p027 and forward -- the dropped curve now is a 3D curve which 
can be drawn. It contains its uv representation on the surface. Previously, the uv-curve
was the actual dropped-curve.




@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curve-in}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL NURBS Curve. The curve to be dropped to the surface.

@end itemize

@b{:surface}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL NURBS Surface. The surface on which the curve-in is to be dropped.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Computed-slots}

@b{:built-from}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve. Specify this if you want this curve to be a clone of an existing curve. (note - this uses a shared underlying 
curve object, it does not make a copy)

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Hidden-objects}

@b{:uv-curve}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve object. The corresponding UV curve for the primary surface on which this curve lies, if any. If
this is not a surface-curve, this will return an error.
