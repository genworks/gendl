@subsubsection Spherical-surface

@b{Description}

A surface representation of the sphere. Takes the same inputs as native GDL sphere. Partial spheres are not yet implmented.
Note that some VRML browsers, e.g. Cortona v. 4.2, show some spurious artifacts with NURBS 
created as spherical surfaces. BS Contact does not appear to have this problem.
