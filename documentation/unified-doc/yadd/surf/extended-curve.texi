@subsubsection Extended-curve

@b{Description}

Creates an extended curve extending its start or end  (@i{u1} and @i{u2}).

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curve-in}

@itemize {}

 @item GDL Curve Object. The underlying curve from which to build this curve.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:continuity}

@itemize {}

 @item Keyword. Specified the extention continuity. If :g1 the curve is extended  by a linear segment. Curve-in is at least G1(possibly C1) 
    where the extension joins the original curve. If :g2 the curve is extended by reflection,  yielding a G2 continuous extension. 
    If :cmax  the extension yields infinite(C) continuity at the join point(no knot there). Defaults to the :g2.

@end itemize

@b{:distance}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Specified the distance to which the curve is extended.

@end itemize

@b{:distance-type}

@itemize {}

 @item Keyword. Specified if the distance is an absolute distance :absolute or the distance is scaled by the curve's arc length
     to yield the desired extension distance :relative. Defaults to the :absolute.

@end itemize

@b{:extending-from}

@itemize {}

 @item Keyword. Specified from which end the curve to be extended. If :start the curve is extended back from  its  start point.
    If :end the the curve is extended forward from its end point. Defaults to the :start.

@end itemize
