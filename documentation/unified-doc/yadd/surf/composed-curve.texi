@subsubsection Composed-curve

@b{Description}

Creates a single NURBS curve from a list (ordered or unordered) NURBS curves. 
If the result is more than one curve, this object will throw an error and you should use @i{composed-curves}
instead.

@noindent @b{Required-input-slots}

@b{:curves}

@itemize {}

 @item List of GDL curve objects. These are the curves to be composed into a single curve.

@end itemize

@noindent @b{Optional-input-slots}

@b{:coincident-point-tolerance}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance two curve endpoints can be apart and be considered coincident, the composite will be built
without doing anything to the endpoints. Default is 0.01. Note: This input-slot must be non-zero.

@end itemize

@b{:distance-to-create-line}

@itemize {}

 @item Number. Distance two curve endpoints can be apart and have a linear curve segment automatically added between the points. Default is 0.1.
