\chapter{Introduction}

\label{chap:introduction}



\section{Welcome}

\label{sec:welcome}

Congratulations on your decision to work with Genworks\textsuperscript{\textregistered} GDL\texttrademark\footnote{From time to time, you will also see references to
``Gendl.'' This refers to ``The Gendl Project'' which is the name of
an open-source software project from which Genworks GDL draws for its
core technology. ``The Gendl Project'' code is free to use for any
purpose, but it is released under the Gnu Affero General Public
License, which stipulates that applications code compiled with The
Gendl Project compiler must be distributed as open-source under a
compatible license (if distributed at all). Commercial Genworks GDL,
properly licensed for development and/or runtime distribution, does
not have this ``copyleft'' open-sourcing requirement.}. By investing time to learn this system you will be investing
in your future productivity and, in the process, you will be joining a
quiet revolution. Although you may have come to Genworks GDL because
of an interest in 3D modeling or mechanical engineering, you will find
that a whole new world, and a unique approach to \emph{computing}, will now be at your fingertips as well.

\section{Knowledge Base Concepts According to Genworks}

\label{sec:knowledgebaseconceptsaccordingtogenworks}

You may have an idea about Knowledge Base Systems,
or Knowledge \emph{Based} Systems, from college textbooks or corporate marketing
literature, and concluded that the concepts were too broad to be of
practical use. Or you may have heard criticisms implicit in the
pretentious-sounding name, ``Knowledge-based Engineering,'' as in:
``you mean as opposed to \index{Ignorance-based Engineering}Ignorance-based Engineering?'' 

To provide a clearer picture, we hope you will concur that Genworks'
concept of a KB system is straightforward, relatively uncomplicated,
and practical. In this manual our goal is to make you both comfortable
and motivated to explore the ideas we have built into our flagship
system, Genworks GDL.

Our informal definition of a \emph{\index{Knowledge Base System}Knowledge Base System} is a hybrid \emph{Object-Oriented}\footnote{An \emph{Object-Oriented} programming environment supports named collections of data values and procedures to operate on that data.} and \emph{Functional}\footnote{A pure \emph{Functional} programming environment supports only the definition and execution of Functions which work by returning
computed values, but do not modify the in-memory state of any data values.} programming environment, which implements the features of \emph{\index{Caching}Caching} and \emph{\index{Dependency tracking}Dependency tracking}. Caching means that once the KB has computed something, it
generally will not need to repeat that computation if the same
question is asked again. Dependency tracking is the flip side of that
coin --- it ensures that if a cached result is \emph{stale}, the result will be recomputed the next time it is \emph{demanded}, so as to give a fresh result.

\section{Classic Definition of Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE)}

\label{sec:classicdefinitionofknowledgebasedengineering(kbe)}

Sections 
\ref{sec:classicdefinitionofknowledgebasedengineering(kbe)} through 
\ref{sec:object-orienteddesign} are sourced from 
\cite{LaRocca}.

\begin{quote}
Knowlege based engineering (KBE) is a technology predicated on
the use of dedicated software tools called KBE systems, which are able
to capture and systematically re-use product and process engineering
knowledge, with the final goal of reducing the time and costs of
product development by means of the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Automation of repetitive and non-creative design tasks;

\item Support of multidisciplinary design optimization in all  
phases of the design process

\end{itemize}



\end{quote}


\section{Runtime Value Caching and Dependency Tracking}

\label{sec:runtimevaluecachinganddependencytracking}



\begin{quote}


Caching refers to the ability of the KBE system to memorize at
runtime the results of computed values (e.g. computed slots and
instantiated objects), so that they can be reused when required,
without the need to re-compute them again and again, unless necessary.
The dependency tracking mechanism serves to keep track of the current
validity of the cached values.  As soon as these values are no longer
valid (stale), they are set to unbound and recomputed if and only at
the very moment they are again demanded.



This dependency tracking mechanism is at the base of associative
modeling, which is of extreme interest for engineering design
applications. For example, the shape of a wing rib can be defined
accordingly to the shape of the wing aerodynamic surface. In case the
latter is modified, the dependency tracking mechanism will notify the
system that the given rib instance is no longer valid and will be
eliminated from the product tree, together with all the
information (objects and attributes) depending on it. The new rib
object, including its attributes and the rest of the affected
information, will not be re-instantiated/updated/re-evaluated
automatically, but only when and if needed (see demand driven
instantiation in the next section)



\end{quote}


\section{Demand-Driven Evaluation}

\label{sec:demand-drivenevaluation}



\begin{quote}
KBE systems use the \emph{demand-driven} approach. That is, they evaluate just those chains of
expressions required to satisfy a direct request of the user (i.e. the
evaluation of certain attributes for the instantiation of an object),
or the indirect requests of another object, which is trying to satisfy
a user demand. For example, the system will create an instance of the
rib object only when the weight of the abovementioned wing rib is
required. The reference wing surface will be generated only when the
generation of the rib object is required, and so on, until all the
information required to respond to the user request will be made
available.

It should be recognized that a typical object tree can be structured
in hundreds of branches and include thousands of attributes. Hence,
the ability to evaluate specific attributes and product model branches
at demand, without the need to evaluate the whole model from its root,
prevents waste of computational resources and in many cases brings
seemingly intractible problems to a rapid and solution.

\end{quote}


\section{Object-oriented Systems}

\label{sec:object-orientedsystems}



\begin{quote}
An object-oriented system is composed of
       objects (i.e. concrete instantiations of named classes), and
       the behavior of the system results from the collaboration of
       those objects. Collaboration between objects involves them
       sending messages to each other. Sending a message differs from
       calling a function in the sense that when a target object
       receives a message, it decides on its own what function to
       carry out to service that message. The same message may be
       implemented by many different functions, the one selected
       depending on the current state of the target object.

\end{quote}


\section{Object-oriented Analysis}

\label{sec:object-orientedanalysis}



\begin{quote}


Object-oriented analysis (OOA) is the process of analyzing
       a task (also known as a problem domain) to develop a conceptual
       model that can then be used to complete the task. A typical OOA
       model would describe computer software that could be used to
       satisfy a set of customer-defined requirements. During the
       analysis phase of problem-solving, the analyst might consider a
       written requirements statement, a formal vision document, or
       interviews with stakeholders or other interested parties. The
       task to be addressed might be divided into several subtasks (or
       domains), each representing a different business,
       technological, or other area of interest. Each subtask would be
       analyzed separately. Implementation
       constraints (e.g. concurrency, distribution, persistence, or
       how the system is to be built) are not considered during the
       analysis phase; rather, they are addressed during
       object-oriented design (OOD) phase.



The conceptual model that results from OOA will typically consist of a
set of use cases, one or more UML class diagrams, and a number of
interaction diagrams. It may also include some form of user interface.



\end{quote}


\section{Object-oriented Design}

\label{sec:object-orienteddesign}



\begin{quote}
During the object-oriented design (OOD) phase, a developer
applies implementation constraints to the conceptual model produced in
object-oriented analysis. Such constraints could include not only
those imposed by the chosen architecture but also any
non-functional --- technological or environmental --- constraints,
such as transaction throughput, response time, run-time platform,
development environment, or those inherent in the programming
language. Concepts in the analysis model are mapped onto
implementation classes and interfaces resulting in a model of the
solution domain, i.e., a detailed description of \emph{how} the system is to be built.

\end{quote}


\section{The Object-Oriented Paradigm meets the Functional paradigm}

\label{sec:theobject-orientedparadigmmeetsthefunctionalparadigm}

In order to model very complex products and efficiently manage
large bodies of knowledge, KBE systems tap the potential of the object
oriented nature of their underlying language (e.g. Common
Lisp). ``Object'' in this context refers to an instantiated data
structure \emph{of a particular assigned data type}. As is well-known in the computing community, unrestricted state
modification of objects leads to unmaintainable systems which are
difficult to debug. KBE systems manage this drawback by strictly
controlling and constraining any ability to modify or ``change state''
of objects.

In essence, a KBE system generates a tree of inspectable objects which
is analogous to the function call tree of pure functional-language
systems.

\section{Goals for this Manual}

\label{sec:goalsforthismanual}

This manual is designed as a companion to a live two-hour
GDL/GWL tutorial, but you may also be relying on it independently of the
video tutorial. In either case, the fundamental goals are:

\begin{itemize}

\item To get you motivated about using Genworks GDL

\item Enable you to ascertain whether Genworks GDL is an appropriate tool for a given job

\item Equip you with the ability to state the case for using GDL/GWL when appropriate

\item Prepare you to begin authoring and maintaining GDL
applications, or porting apps from similar KB systems into GDL.

\end{itemize}

The manual will begin with an introduction to the \index{Common Lisp}Common Lisp programming language. If you are new to Common Lisp:
congratulations! You are about to be introduced to a powerful tool
backed by a rock-solid standard specification, which will protect your
development investment for decades to come. In addition to the
overview in this manual, many resources are available to get you
started in CL --- for starters, we recommend 
\underline{\index{Basic Lisp Techniques}Basic Lisp Techniques}\footnote{
\underline{BLT} is available at \texttt{http://www.franz.com/resources/educational\_resources/cooper.book.pdf}}, which was written by the author. 

\section{What is GDL?}

\label{sec:whatisgdl?}

GDL is an acronym for
``General-purpose Declarative Language.''

\begin{itemize}

\item GDL is a superset of ANSI Common Lisp, and consists largely of
automatic code-expanding extensions to Common Lisp implemented in the
form of macros. When you write, for example, 20 lines in GDL, you
might be writing the equivalent of 200 lines of Common Lisp. Given
that GDL is a superset of Common Lisp, you of course still have the
full power of the CL language at your disposal whenever you are
working in GDL.
\index{compiled language!benefits of}\index{macros!code-expanding}
\item Since GDL expands into CL, everything you write in GDL will be
compiled ``down to the metal'' to machine code with all the
optimizations and safety that the tested-and-true CL compiler provides
[this is an important distinction as contrasted to some other
so-called KB systems on the market, which are essentially nothing more
than interpreted \emph{scripting languages} which often impose arbitrary limits on
the size and complexity of the application.

\item GDL is also a \emph{\index{declarative}declarative} language in the fullest sense. When you put together a
GDL application, you write and think mainly in terms of objects and
their properties, and how they depend on one another in a direct
sense. You do not have to track in your mind explicitly how one object
or property will ``call'' another object or propery, in what order
this will happen, etc. Those details are taken care of for you
automatically by the embedded language.

\item Because GDL is object-oriented, you have all the features you would normally expect
from an object-oriented language, such as 

\begin{itemize}

\item Separation between the \emph{definition} of an object and an \emph{instance} of an object

\item High levels of data abstraction

\item The ability for one object to ``inherit'' from others

\item The ability to ``use'' an object without concern for
	its ``under-the-hood'' complexities

\end{itemize}

\index{object-orientation!message-passing}\index{object-orientation!generic-function}

\item GDL supports the ``message-passing'' paradigm of object
orientation, with some extensions. Since full-blown ANSI CLOS (Common
Lisp Object System) is always available as well, the Generic Function
paradigm is supported as well. Do not be concerned at this point if
you are not fully aware of the differences between Message Passing
and Generic Function models of object-orientation.\footnote{See Paul Graham's 
\underline{ANSI Common Lisp}, page 192, for an excellent discussion of the Two Models 
of Object-oriented Programming.}.

\end{itemize}



\section{Why GDL (i.e., what is GDL good for?)}

\label{sec:whygdl(i.e.,whatisgdlgoodfor?)}



\begin{itemize}

\item Organizing and integrating large amounts of
information in ways not possible, or not practical, using conventional
languages or conventional relational database technology alone;

\item Evaluating many design or engineering alternatives and 
performing various kinds of optimizations within specified design
spaces, and doing so very rapidly;

\item Capturing, i.e., implementing, the procedures and rules used
to solve repetitive tasks in engineering and other fields;

\item Applying rules you have specified to achieve intermediate
and final outputs, which may include virtual models of wireframe,
surface, and solid geometric objects.

\end{itemize}



\section{What GDL is not}

\label{sec:whatgdlisnot}



\begin{itemize}

\item A CAD system (although it may operate on and/or generate geometric entities);

\item A drawing program (although it may operate on and/or generate geometric entities);

\item An Artificial Intelligence system (although it is an
excellent environment for developing capabilities which could qualify
as such);

\item An Expert System Shell (although one could be easily embedded within it).

\end{itemize}

Without further definitions, let's turn the page and get
      started with hands-on GDL...

\chapter{Installation}

\label{chap:installation}

Follow Section 
\ref{sec:installationofpre-packagedgdl} if your email address is registered with Genworks and you will
install a pre-packaged Genworks GDL distribution including its own
Common Lisp engine.  The foundation of Genworks GDL is also available
as open-source software through The Gendl Project\footnote{http://github.com/genworks/gendl}; if you want to use that version, then please refer to Section 
\ref{sec:installationofopen-sourcegendl}.

\section{Installation of pre-packaged GDL}

\label{sec:installationofpre-packagedgdl}

This section will take you through the installation of
Genworks GDL from a prepackaged distribution with the Allegro CL or
LispWorks commercial Common Lisp engine and the Slime IDE (based on
Gnu Emacs).

\subsection{Download the Software and retrieve a license key}

\label{subsec:downloadthesoftwareandretrievealicensekey}



\begin{enumerate}

\item Visit the Downloads section of the \href{http://genworks.com}{Genworks Website}

\item Enter your email address\footnote{if your address is not on file, send mail to licensing@genworks.com}.

\item Download the latest Payload for Windows, Linux, or Mac\footnote{Gnu Emacs is included with the download. The source code for this 
is available at http://downloads.genworks.com/emacs-windows-24.3.zip. Gnu Ghostscript
is also included; please contact Genworks if you need the source code for this.}

\item Click to receive the license key file by email.

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Unpack the Distribution}

\label{subsec:unpackthedistribution}

Genworks GDL is currently distributed as a setup executable for Windows,
a ``dmg'' application bundle for Mac, and a self-contained zip file for Linux.

\begin{itemize}

\item Run the installation executable. Accept the defaults when prompted.\footnote{For Linux, you have to install emacs and ghostscript yourself. Please use your distribution's package manager to complete this installation.}

\item Copy the license key file as gdl.lic (for Trial,
	 Student, Professional editions), or devel.lic (for Enterprise edition) into the \texttt{program/} directory within the \texttt{gdl/gdl/program/} directory.

\item Launch the application by finding the Genworks program group in the Start menu (Windows), or by double-clicking the application icon (Mac), or by running the \texttt{run-gdl} script (Linux).

\end{itemize}



\section{Installation of open-source Gendl}

\label{sec:installationofopen-sourcegendl}

This section is only relevant if you have not received a
pre-packaged Gendl distribution with its own Common Lisp engine.  If
you have received a pre-packaged Gendl distribution, then you may skip
this section. In case you want to use the open-source Gendl, you will
use your own Common Lisp installation and obtain Gendl (Genworks-GDL)
using a very powerful and convenient CL package/library manager
called \emph{Quicklisp}.

\subsection{Install and Configure your Common Lisp environment}

\label{subsec:installandconfigureyourcommonlispenvironment}

Gendl is currently tested to build on the following Common Lisp engines:

\begin{itemize}

\item Allegro CL (commercial product from Franz Inc, free Express Edition available)

\item LispWorks (commercial product from LispWorks Ltd, free Personal Edition available)

\item Clozure CL (free CL engine from Clozure Associates, free for all use)

\item Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) (free open-source project with permissive license)

\end{itemize}

Please refer to the documentation for each of these systems
for full information on installing and configuring the
environment. Typically this will include a text editor, either Gnu
Emacs with Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs (Slime), or a
built-in text editing and development environment which comes with the
Common Lisp system.

A convenient way to set up Emacs with Slime is to use the \href{http://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-slime-helper}{Quicklisp-slime-helper}.

\subsection{Load and Configure Quicklisp}

\label{subsec:loadandconfigurequicklisp}

Quicklisp is the defacto standard library manager for Common
Lisp.

\begin{itemize}

\item Visit the \href{http://quicklisp.org}{Quicklisp website}

\item Follow the instructions there to download the \texttt{quicklisp.lisp} bootstrap file and load it to set up your Quicklisp environment.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Load and Start Gendl}

\label{subsec:loadandstartgendl}

invoke the following commands at the Common Lisp toplevel ``repl'' prompt:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \texttt{(ql:quickload :gendl)}

\item \texttt{(gendl:start-gendl!)}

\end{enumerate}



\section{System Testing}

\label{sec:systemtesting}



\subsection{Basic Sanity Test}

\label{subsec:basicsanitytest}

You may test your installation using the following
checklist. These tests are optional. You may perform some or all of
them in order to ensure that your Gendl is installed correctly and
running smoothly. In your Web Browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer), perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item visit http://localhost:9000/tasty.

\item accept default robot:assembly.

\item Select ``Add Leaves'' from the Tree menu.

\item Click on the top node in the tree.

\item Observe the wireframe graphics for the robot as shown in 
\ref{fig:tasty-robot}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in,height=3in]{../images/tasty-robot.png}
\end{center}

\caption{Robot displayed in Tasty}

\label{fig:tasty-robot}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in,height=3in]{../images/tasty-robot-x3dom.png}
\end{center}

\caption{Robot x3dom}

\label{fig:tasty-robot-x3dom}

\end{figure}

\item Click on the robot to zoom in.

\item Select ``Clear View!'' from the View menu.

\item Select ``X3DOM'' from the View menu.

\item Click on the top node in the tree.

\item ``Refresh'' or ``Reload'' your browser window (may not be necessary).

\item If your browser supports WebGL, you will see the robot in shaded dynamic view as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:tasty-robot-x3dom}.

\item Select ``PNG'' from the View menu. You will see the
	 wireframe view of the robot as a PNG image.

\item Select ``X3D'' from the View menu. If your browser
has an X3D plugin installed (e.g. BS Contact), you will see the robot
in a shaded dynamic view.

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Full Regression Test}

\label{subsec:fullregressiontest}

\index{regression tests}The following commands will invoke a full regression test,
including a test of the Surface and Solids primitives provided by the
SMLib geometry kernel. Note that the SMLib geometry kernel is only
available with proprietary Genworks GDL licenses --- therefore if you
have open-source Gendl or a lite Trial version of Genworks GDL, 
these regression tests will not all function.

In Emacs at the \texttt{gdl-user>} prompt in the \texttt{*slime-repl...*} buffer, type the following commands:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \texttt{(ql:quickload :regression)}

\item \texttt{(gdl-lift-utils::define-regression-tests)}

\item \texttt{(gdl-lift-utils::run-regression-tests-pass-fail)}

\item \texttt{(pprint gdl-lift-utils::*regression-test-report*)}

\end{enumerate}



\section{Getting Help and Support}

\label{sec:gettinghelpandsupport}

If you encounter unexplained errors in the installation and
startup process, please contact the following resources:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Make a posting to the \href{http://groups.google.com/group/genworks}{Genworks Google Group}

\item Join the \#gendl IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel on
	irc.freenode.net and discuss issues there.

\item For exclusively Common Lisp issues, join the \#lisp
	IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel on irc.freenode.net and
	discuss issues there.

\item Also for Common Lisp issues, follow the comp.lang.lisp
	Usenet group.

\item If you are a supported Genworks customer, send email to \href{mailto:support@genworks.com}{support@genworks.com}

\item If you are not a supported Genworks customer but you want to report an apparent bug or have other suggestions or inquiries, you may also send email to \href{mailto:support@genworks.com}{support@genworks.com}, but as a non-customer please understand that Genworks
	  cannot guarantee a response or a particular timeframe for a
	  response. Also note that we are not able to offer guaranteed
	  support for Trial and Student licenses 

\end{enumerate}



\chapter{Basic Operation of the GDL Environment}

\label{chap:basicoperationofthegdlenvironment}

This chapter will lead you through all the basic steps of
operating a typical GDL-based development environment. We will not go
into particular depth about the additional features of the environment
or language syntax in this section --- this is merely for getting
familiar and practicing with the mechanics of operating the
environment with a keyboard.

\section{What is Different about GDL?}

\label{sec:whatisdifferentaboutgdl?}

GDL is a dynamic language environment with incremental
compiling and in-memory definitions. That means that as long as the
system is running you can \emph{compile} new \emph{definitions} of functions, objects, etc, and they will immediately become
available as part of the running system, and you can begin testing
them immediately, or update an existing set of objects to observe
their new behavior.

In many other programming language systems, to introduce a new
function or object, one has \emph{to start the system from the beginning} and reload all the files in order to test new functionality.
 
In GDL, it is typical to keep the same development session up and
running for an entire day or longer, making it unnecessary to
constantly recompile and reload your definitions from scratch. Note,
however, that if you do shut down and restart the system for some
reason, then you will have to recompile and/or reload your
application's definitions in order to bring the system back into a
state where it can instantiate (or ``run'') your application.

While this can be done manually at the command-line, it is typically
done \emph{automatically} in one of two ways:

\begin{enumerate}

\item using commands placed into
the \texttt{gdlinit.cl} initialization file, as introduced in Section 
\ref{sec:customizingyourenvironment}.

\item alternatively, you can compile and load definitions into
your session, then save the ``world'' in that state. That way it is
possible to start a new GDL ``world'' which already has all your
application's definitions loaded and ready for use, without having to
procedurally reload any files. You can then begin to make and test new
definitions (and re-definitions) starting from this new ``world.''

\end{enumerate}



\section{Startup, ``Hello, World!'' and Shutdown}

\label{sec:startup,hello,world!andshutdown}



The typical GDL environment consists of three programs: Gnu
Emacs (the editor), a Common Lisp engine with GDL system loaded or built into it (e.g. the \texttt{gdl.exe} executable in your \texttt{program/} directory), and (optionally) a web browser
such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, or Internet
Explorer. Emacs runs as the main \emph{process}, and this in turn starts the CL engine with GDL as a \emph{sub-process}. The CL engine typically runs an embedded \emph{webserver}, enabling you to access your application through a standard web browser.



As introduced in Chapter 
\ref{chap:installation}, the typical way to start a pre-packaged GDL environment is with the \texttt{run-gdl.bat} (Windows), or \texttt{run-gdl} (MacOS, Linux) script files, or with the installed Start
program item (Windows) or application bundle (MacOS). Invoke this
script file from the Start menu (Windows), your computer's file
manager, or from a desktop shortcut if you have created one.  Your
installation executable may also have created a Windows ``Start'' menu
item for Genworks GDL. You can of course also invoke \texttt{run-gdl.bat} from the Windows ``cmd'' command-line, or from another command shell such as Cygwin.\footnote{Cygwin is also useful as a command-line tool on Windows
for interacting with a version control system like Subversion (svn).}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in,height=4in]{../images/emacs-startup.png}
\end{center}

\caption{Startup of Emacs with GDL}

\label{fig:emacs-startup}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Startup}

\label{subsec:startup}

 Startup of a typical GDL development session consists of
two fundamental steps: (1) starting the Emacs editing environment,
and (2) starting the actual GDL process as a ``sub-process'' or ``inferior'' process 
within Emacs. The GDL process should automatically establish a network connection
back to Emacs, allowing you to interact directly with the GDL process from within Emacs.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Invoke the \texttt{run-gdl.bat}, \texttt{run-gdl.bat}
startup script, or the provided executable from the Start
menu (windows) or application bundle (Mac).

\item You should see an emacs window similar to that shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:emacs-startup}. (alternative colors are also possible).

\item (MS Windows): Look for the Genworks GDL Console
window, or (Linux, Mac) use the Emacs ``Buffer'' menu to visit the
``*inferior-lisp*'' buffer. Note that the Genworks GDL Console
window might start as a minimized icon; click or double-click it to
un-minimize.

\item Watch the Genworks GDL Console window for any
errors. Depending on your specific installation, it may take from a
few seconds to several minutes for the Genworks GDL Console (or
*inferior-lisp* buffer) to settle down and give you a \texttt{gdl-user(): } prompt. This window is where you will see most of your program's textual output, any 
error messages, warnings, etc.

\item In Emacs, type: \texttt{C-x \&} (or select Emacs menu item Buffers$\rightarrow$*slime-repl...*) to visit the ``*slime-repl ...*'' buffer. The full name
of this buffer depends on the specific CL/GDL platform which you are
running. This buffer contains an interactive prompt, labeled \texttt{gdl-user>}, where you will enter most of your commands to interact with your running GDL session
for testing, debugging, etc. There is also a web-based graphical interactive environment called \emph{tasty} which will be discussed in Chapter 
\ref{chap:thetastydevelopmentenvironment}.

\item To ensure that the GDL command prompt is up and running, type: \texttt{(+ 2 3)} and press [Enter].

\item You should see the result \texttt{5} echoed back to you below the prompt.

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Developing and Testing a  ``Hello World'' application}

\label{subsec:developingandtestingahelloworldapplication}

 

\begin{enumerate}

\item type C-x (Control-x) 2, or C-x 3, or use the ``Split
Screen'' option of the File menu to split the Emacs frame into two
``windows'' (``windows'' in Emacs are non-overlapping panels, or
rectangular areas within the main Emacs window).

\item type C-x o several times to move from one window to
the other, or move the mouse cursor and click in each window. Notice
how the blinking insertion point moves from one window to the other.

\item In the top (or left) window, type C-x C-f (or select Emacs menu item
``File$\rightarrow$Open File'') to get the ``Find file'' prompt in the
mini-buffer.

\item Type C-a to move the point to the beginning of the mini-buffer line.

\item Type C-k to delete from the point to the end of the mini-buffer.

\item Type \texttt{\textasciitilde/hello.gdl} and press [Enter]

\item You are now editing a (presumably new) file of GDL
	 code, located in your HOME directory, called \texttt{hello.gdl}

\item Enter the text from Figure 
\ref{fig:simpleobjectdefinition} into the \texttt{hello.gdl} buffer. You do not have to match the line breaks and whitespace as shown in the example.
You can auto-indent each new line by pressing [TAB] after pressing [Enter] for the newline.

\emph{Protip:}You can also try using \texttt{C-j} instead of [Enter], which will automatically give a newline and auto-indent.

\label{fig:simpleobjectdefinition}

\end{figure}

\item type \texttt{C-x C-s} (or choose Emacs menu item \emph{File$\rightarrow$Save}) to save the contents of the buffer (i.e. the window) 
to the file in your HOME directory.

\item type \texttt{C-c C-k} (or choose Emacs menu item \emph{SLIME$\rightarrow$Compilation$\rightarrow$Compile/Load File}) to compile \& load the code from this file.

\item type \texttt{C-c o} (or move and click the mouse)  to switch to the bottom window.

\item In the bottom window, type \texttt{C-x \&} (or choose Emacs menu item \emph{Buffers$\rightarrow$*slime-repl...*}) to get the \texttt{*slime-repl ...*} buffer, which should contain a \texttt{gdl-user>} prompt. This is where you normally type interactive GDL commands.

\item If necessary, type \texttt{M \textgreater} (that is, hold down Meta (Alt), Shift, and the ``\textgreater'' key) to
move the insertion point to the end of this buffer.

\item At the \texttt{gdl-user>} prompt, type 

\begin{verbatim}(make-self 'hello)
\end{verbatim} and press [Enter].

\item At the \texttt{gdl-user>} prompt, type 

\begin{verbatim}(the greeting)
\end{verbatim} and press [Enter].

\item You should see the words \texttt{Hello, World!} echoed back to you below the prompt.

\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Shutdown}

\label{subsec:shutdown}

 To shut down a development session gracefully, you should first shut down the GDL process,
then shut down your Emacs.

\begin{itemize}

\item Type \texttt{M-x quit-gdl} (that is, hold Alt and press X, then release both while you type \texttt{quit-gdl} in the mini-buffer), then press [Enter]

\item alternatively, you can type \texttt{C-x \&} (that is, hold Control and press X, then release both while you type \&. 
This will visit the *slime-repl* buffer. Now type: \texttt{, q} to quit the GDL session.

\item Finally, type \texttt{C-x C-c} to quit from Emacs. Emacs will prompt you to save any
	   modified buffers before exiting.

\end{itemize}



\section{Working with Projects}

\label{sec:workingwithprojects}

GDL contains utilities which allow you to treat your
application as a ``project,'' with the ability to compile,
incrementally compile, and load a ``project'' from a directory tree of
source files representing your project. In this section we give an
overview of the expected directory structure and available control
files, followed by a reference for each of the functions included in
the bootstrap module.

\subsection{Directory Structure}

\label{subsec:directorystructure}



You should structure your applications in a modular fashion, with the
directories containing actual Lisp sources called "source."



You may have subdirectories which themselves contain "source"
directories.



We recommend keeping your codebase directories relatively flat,
however.



In Figure 
\ref{fig:yoyodyne-base} is an example application directory, with four source files.


\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/assembly.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/package.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/parameters.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/rules.gdl

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Example project directory with four source files}

\label{fig:yoyodyne-base}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Source Files within a source/ subdirectory}

\label{subsec:sourcefileswithinasource/subdirectory}



\subsubsection{Enforcing Ordering}

\label{subsubsec:enforcingordering}



Within a source subdirectory, you may have a file called \texttt{file-ordering.isc}\footnote{\texttt{isc} stands for ``Intelligent Source Configuration''} to enforce a certain ordering on the files. Here is the contents of an example for the 
above application:



\begin{verbatim}("package" "parameters")
\end{verbatim}

This will force package.lisp to be compiled/loaded first, and
parameters.lisp to be compiled/loaded next. The ordering on the rest
of the files should not matter (although it will default to
lexigraphical ordering).



Now our sample application directory looks like Figure 
\ref{fig:yoyodyne-with-file-ordering-isc}.


\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/assembly.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/file-ordering.isc
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/package.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/parameters.gdl
  apps/yoyodyne/booster-rocket/source/rules.gdl
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Example project directory with file ordering configuration file}

\label{fig:yoyodyne-with-file-ordering-isc}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Generating an ASDF System}

\label{subsec:generatinganasdfsystem}



ASDF stands for Another System Definition Facility, which
	is the predominant system in use for Common Lisp third-party
	libraries. With GDL, you can use the \texttt{:create-asd-file?} keyword argument to make cl-lite generate an ASDF system
file instead of actually compiling and loading the system. For example: 

\begin{verbatim}(cl-lite "apps/yoyodyne/" :create-asd-file? t)
\end{verbatim}



In order to include a depends-on clause in your ASDF system file, create a file called \texttt{depends-on.isc} in the toplevel directory of your system. In this file,
place a list of the systems your system depends on. This can be
systems from your own local projects, or from third-party libraries.
For example, if your system depends on the \texttt{:cl-json} third-party library, you would have the following contents in your \texttt{depends-on.isc}: 

\begin{verbatim}(:cl-json)
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Compiling and Loading a System}

\label{subsec:compilingandloadingasystem}

Once you have generated an ASDF file, you can compile and
load the system using Quicklisp. To do this for our example, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}(cl-lite "apps/yoyodyne/" :create-asd-file? t)
\end{verbatim} to generate the asdf file for the yoyodyne system. This only has to be done once after every time you add, remove, or rename a file or folder from the system.

\item 

\begin{verbatim}(pushnew "apps/yoyodyne/" ql:*local-project-directories*)
\end{verbatim} This can be done in your \texttt{gdlinit.cl} for projects you want available during every development session. Note that you should include
the full path prefix for the directory containing the ASDF system file.

\item 

\begin{verbatim}(ql:quickload :gdl-yoyodyne)
\end{verbatim} this will compile and load the actual system. Quicklisp
uses ASDF at the low level to compile and load the systems, and
Quicklisp will retrieve any depended-upon third-party libraries from
the Internet on-demand.  Source files will be compiled only if the
corresponding binary (fasl) file does not exist or is older than the
source file. By default, ASDF keeps its binary files in a  \emph{cache} directory, separated according to CL platform and
operating system. The location of this cache is system-dependent, but
you can see where it is by observing the compile and load
process.

\end{enumerate}



\section{Customizing your Environment}

\label{sec:customizingyourenvironment}

 You may customize your environment in several different ways,
for example by loading definitions and settings into your GDL
``world'' automatically when the system starts, and by specifying
fonts, colors, and default buffers (to name a few) for your emacs
editing environment.

\section{Saving the World}

\label{sec:savingtheworld}

``Saving the world'' refers to a technique of saving a complete
binary image of your GDL ``world'' which contains all the currently
compiled and loaded definitions and settings.  This allows you to
start up a saved world almost instantly, without being required to
reload all the definitions. You can then incrementally compile and
load just the particular definitions which you are working on for your
development session.

To save a world, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Load the base GDL code and (optionally) code for GDL
modules (e.g. gdl-yadd, gdl-tasty) you want to be in your saved image. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
 (ql:quickload :gdl-yadd) 
 (ql:quickload :gdl-tasty)
\end{verbatim}


\item



\begin{verbatim}(ff:unload-foreign-library (merge-pathnames "smlib.dll" "sys:smlib;"))
\end{verbatim}

\item



\begin{verbatim}(net.aserve:shutdown)
\end{verbatim}

\item



\begin{verbatim}(setq excl:*restart-init-function* '(gdl:start-gdl :edition :trial))
\end{verbatim}
\item  (to save an image named yoyodyne.dxl) Invoke the command 

\begin{verbatim}(dumplisp :name "yoyodyne.dxl")
\end{verbatim}Note that the standard extension for Allegro CL images is \texttt{.dxl}. Prepend the file name with path information, to write the image to a specific location.

\end{enumerate}



\section{Starting up a Saved World}

\label{sec:startingupasavedworld}

In order to start up GDL using a custom saved image, or ``world,'' follow these steps

\begin{enumerate}

\item Exit GDL

\item Copy the supplied \texttt{gdl.dxl} to \texttt{gdl-orig.dxl}.

\item Move the custom saved dxl image to \texttt{gdl.dxl} in the GDL application \texttt{"program/"} directory.

\item Start GDL as usual. Note: you may have to edit the system gdlinit.cl or your home gdlinit.cl
to stop it from loading redundant code which is already in the saved image.

\end{enumerate}



\chapter{Understanding Common Lisp}

\label{chap:understandingcommonlisp}



GDL is a superset of Common Lisp, and is ``embedded'' in
Common Lisp. This means that when working with GDL you have the full
power of CL available to you. The lowest-level expressions in a GDL
definition are CL ``symbolic expressions,'' or ``s-expressions.''
This chapter will familiarize you with CL s-expressions.



\section{S-expression Fundamentals}

\label{sec:s-expressionfundamentals}



S-expressions can be used in your definitions to establish
the value of a particular \emph{slot} (i.e. named data value) in an object, which will be
computed on-demand. You can also evaluate S-expressions at the
toplevel \texttt{gdl-user\textgreater} prompt, and see the result immediately. In fact, this toplevel prompt is called a \emph{read-eval-print} loop, because its purpose is to \emph{read} each s-expression  entered, \emph{evaluate} the expression to yield a result (or \emph{return-value}), and finally to \emph{print} that result.



CL s-expressions use a  \emph{prefix} notation, which means that they consist of either an \emph{atom} (e.g.  number, text string, symbol) or a \emph{list} (one or more items enclosed by parentheses, where the
	  first item is taken as a symbol which names an
	  operator). Here is an example: 

\begin{verbatim}(+ 2 2)
\end{verbatim}This expression consists of the function named by the symbol \texttt{+}, followed by the numeric arguments \texttt{2} and another \texttt{2}. As you may have guessed, when this expression is evaluated it will return the value 4.\emph{Try it: }try typing this expression at your command prompt, and see
the return-value being printed on the console. What is actually
happening here? When CL is asked to evaluate an expression, it
processes the expression according to the following rules:





\begin{itemize}

\item If the expression is an \emph{atom} (e.g. a non-list datatype such as a number, text
string, or literal symbol), it simply returns itself as its evaluated
value. Examples: 

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> 99
99
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> 99.9
99.9
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> 3/5
3/5
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> "Bob"
"Bob"
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> "Our golden rule is simplicity"
"Our golden rule is simplicity"
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> 'my-symbol
my-symbol
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

Note that numbers are represented directly (with decimal
points and slashes for fractions allowed), strings are surrounded by
double-quotes, and literal symbols are introduced with a preceding
single-quote. Symbols are allowed to have dashes (``-'') and most
other special characters. By convention, the dash is used as a word
separator in CL symbols.

\item If the expression is a \emph{list} (i.e. is surrounded by parentheses), CL processes
the \emph{first} element in this list as an \emph{operator name}, and the \emph{rest} of the elements in the list represent the \emph{arguments} to the operator. An operator can take zero or more
arguments, and can return zero or more return-values. Some operators
evaluate their arguments immediately and work directly on those
values (these are called \emph{functions}). Other operators expand into other code. These are called \emph{special operators} or \emph{macros}. Macros are what give Lisp (and CL in particular) its
special power. Here are some examples of functional s-expressions: 

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (expt 2 5)
32
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (+ 2 5)
7
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (+ 2)
2
\end{verbatim}

\item 

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (+ (+ 2 2) (+ 3 3 ))
10
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}



\end{itemize}





\section{Fundamental CL Data Types}

\label{sec:fundamentalcldatatypes}



As we have seen, Common Lisp natively supports
many data types common to other languages, such as numbers and text
strings. CL also contains several compound data types such as lists,
arrays, and hash tables. CL contains \emph{symbols} as well, which typically are used as names for other data elements.



Regarding data types, CL follows a system called dynamic
typing. Basically this means that values have type, but variables do
not necessarily have type, and typically variables are not
``pre-declared'' to be of a particular type.



\subsection{Numbers}

\label{subsec:numbers}



As we have seen, numbers in CL are a native
data type which simply evaluate to themselves when entered at the
toplevel or included in an expression.



Numbers in CL form a hierarchy of types, which includes Integers,
Ratios, Floating Point, and Complex numbers. For many purposes, you
only need to think of a value as a ``number'' without getting any more
specific than that. Most arithmetic operations, such as \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/} etc, will automaticaly do any necessary type coercion on their
arguments and will return a number of the appropriate type.

CL supports a full range of floating-point decimal numbers, as well as
true Ratios, which means that \texttt{1/3} is a true one-third, not \texttt{0.333333333} rounded off at some arbitrary precision.



\subsection{Strings}

\label{subsec:strings}



Strings are actually a specialized kind of
array, namely a one-dimensional array (vector) made up of text
characters. These characters can be letters, numbers, or punctuation,
and in some cases can include characters from international character
sets (e.g. Unicode or UTF-8) such as Chinese Hanzi or Japanese
Kanji. The string delimiter in CL is the double-quote character.



As we have seen, strings in CL are a native data type which simply
evaluate to themselves when included in an expression.



A common way to produce a string in CL is with the \texttt{format} function. Although the \texttt{format} function can be used to send output to any kind of destination, or \emph{stream}, it will simply yield a string if you specify \texttt{nil} for the stream. Example: 
{\small

\begin{verbatim}
 gdl-user> (format nil "The time is: ~a" (get-universal-time))
 "The time is: 3564156603"
 gdl-user> (format nil "The time is: ~a" (iso-8601-date (get-universal-time)))
 "The time is: 2012-12-10"
 gdl-user> (format nil "The time is: ~a" (iso-8601-date (get-universal-time) :include-time? t))
 "The time is: 2012-12-10T14:30:17"
\end{verbatim}}



As you can see from the above example, \texttt{format} takes a \emph{stream designator} or \texttt{nil} as its first argument, then a \emph{format-string}, then enough arguments to match the \emph{format directives} in the format-string. Format directives begin with the
tilde character (\~).  The format-directive \texttt{~a} indicates that the printed representation of the corresonding argument should simpy be 
substituted into the format-string at the point where it occurs.



We will cover more details on \texttt{format} in Section 
\ref{sec:input-output} on Input/Output, but for now, a familiarity with the simple use of \texttt{(format nil ...)} will be helpful for Chapter 
\ref{chap:understandinggdl---coregdlsyntax}.



\subsection{Symbols}

\label{subsec:symbols}



Symbols are such an important data structure in CL that people
sometimes refer to CL as a ``Symbolic Computing Language.'' Symbols
are a type of CL object which provides your program with a built-in
capacity to store and retrieve values and functions, as well as being
useful in their own right. A symbol is most often known by its name
 (actually a string), but in fact there is much more to a symbol than
its name. In addition to the name, symbols also contain a \emph{function} slot, a \emph{value} slot, and an open-ended \emph{property-list} slot in which you can store an arbitrary number of named properties.



For a named function such as \texttt{+} the function-slot contains the actual function
object for performing numeric addition. The value-slot of a symbol can
contain any value, allowing the symbol to act as a global variable, or \emph{parameter}. And the property-list, also known as the \emph{plist} slot, can contain an arbitrary amount of information.



This separation of the symbol data structure into function, value, and
plist slots is one fundamental distinction between Common Lisp and most
other Lisp dialects. Most other dialects allow only one (1) ``thing''
to be stored in the symbol data structure, other than its name
 (e.g. either a function or a value, but not both at the same
time). Because Common Lisp does not impose this restriction, it is not
necessary to contrive names, for example for your variables, to avoid
conflicting with existing ``reserved words'' in the system. For
example, \texttt{list} is the name of a built-in function in CL. But you
may freely use \texttt{list} as a variable name as well. There is no need to
contrive arbitrary abbreviations such as \texttt{lst}.



How symbols are evaluated depends on where they occur in an
expression. As we have seen, if a \emph{symbol} appears first in a list expression, as with the \texttt{+} in \texttt{(+ 2 2)}, the symbol is evaluated for its function slot. If the first 
element of an expression indeed has a \emph{function} in its function slot, then any 
subsequent symbol in the expression is taken as a variable, and it is evaluated 
for its global or local value, depending on its scope (more on variables and 
scope later).



As noted in Section 3.1.3, if you want a literal symbol itself, one
way to achieve this is to ``quote'' the symbol name:

\begin{verbatim}'a
\end{verbatim}



Another way is for the symbol to appear within a quoted list expression, for example:

\begin{verbatim}'(a b c)
\end{verbatim} or 

\begin{verbatim}'(a (b c) d)
\end{verbatim}



Note that the quote (\texttt{'}) applies across everything in the list expression, including any sub- expressions.



\subsection{List Basics}

\label{subsec:listbasics}



Lisp takes its name from its strong support for the list data
structure. The list concept is important to CL for more than this
reason alone --- most notably, lists are important because \emph{all CL programs are themselves lists.}



 Having the list as a native data structure, as well as the form of all
programs, means that it is straightforward for CL programs to compute
and generate other CL programs. Likewise, CL programs can read and
manipulate other CL programs in a natural manner. This cannot be said
of most other languages, and is one of the primary distinguishing
characteristics of Lisp as a language.



Textually, a list is defined as zero or more items
surrounded by parentheses. The items can be objects of any valid CL
data types, such as numbers, strings, symbols, lists, or other kinds
of objects. According to standard evaluation rules, you must quote a
literal list to evaluate it as such, or CL will assume you are calling
a function. Now look at the following list:

\begin{verbatim}(defun hello () (write-string "Hello, World!"))
\end{verbatim}This list also happens to be a valid CL program (function definition,
in this case). Don't concern yourself about analyzing the function definition
right now, but do take a few moments to convince yourself that it
meets the requirements for a list.



What are the types of the elements in this list?



In addition to using the quote (') to produce a literal list, another
way to produce a list is to call the function \texttt{list}. The function \texttt{list} takes any number of arguments, and returns a list made up
from the result of evaluating each argument. As with all functions,
the arguments to the \texttt{list} function get evaluated, from left to right, before being
processed by the function. For example:

\begin{verbatim}(list ’a ’b (+ 2 2))
\end{verbatim}will return the list

\begin{verbatim}(a b 4)
\end{verbatim}The two quoted symbols evaluate to symbols, and the function
call \texttt{(+ 2 2)} evaluates to the number 4.



\subsection{The List as a Data Structure}

\label{subsec:thelistasadatastructure}

In this section we will present a few of the fundamental native CL operators for manipulating
lists as data structures. These include operators for doing things such as:

\begin{enumerate}

\item finding the length of a list

\item accessing particular members of a list

\item appending multiple lists together to make a new list

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Finding the Length of a List}

\label{subsubsec:findingthelengthofalist}

The function \texttt{length} will return the length of any type of sequence, including a list:

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (length '(a b c d e f g h i j)
10
gdl-user> (length nil)
0
\end{verbatim}Note that \texttt{nil} qualifies as a list (albeit the empty list), so taking its length yields the integer \texttt{0}.

\subsubsection{Accessing the Elements of a List}

\label{subsubsec:accessingtheelementsofalist}

Common Lisp defines the accessor functions \texttt{first} through \texttt{tenth} as a means of accessing the first ten elements in a list:

\begin{verbatim}
gdl-user> (first '(a b c))

a

gdl-user> (second '(a b c))

b

gdl-user> (third '(a b c))

c
\end{verbatim}For accessing elements in an arbitrary position in the list, you can use the function nth,
which takes an integer and a list as its two arguments:

\begin{verbatim}

gdl-user> (nth 0 '(a b c))

a

gdl-user> (nth 1 '(a b c))

b

gdl-user> (nth 2 '(a b c))

c
\end{verbatim}Note that nth starts its indexing at zero (0), so \texttt{(nth 0 ...)} is equivalent to \texttt{(first ...)}and \texttt{(nth 1 ...)} is equivalent to \texttt{(second ...)}, etc.

\subsubsection{Using a List to Store and Retrieve Named Values}

\label{subsubsec:usingalisttostoreandretrievenamedvalues}

Lists can also be used to store and retrieve named values. When a list is used in this way, 
it is called a \emph{plist}. Plists contain pairs of elements, where each pair consists of a \emph{key} and some \emph{value}. The key is typically an actual keyword symbol --- that is,
a symbol preceded by a colon (:). The value can be any value, such as
a number, a string, or even a GDL object representing something
complex such as an aircraft.

A plist can be constructed in the same manner as any list, e.g. with the \texttt{list} operator:

\begin{verbatim}(list :a 10 :b 20 :c 30)
\end{verbatim}In order to access any element in this list, you can use the \texttt{getf} operator. The \texttt{getf} operator is specially intended for use with plists:

\begin{verbatim}gdl-user> (getf (list :a 10 :b 20 :c 30) :b
20
gdl-user> (getf (list :a 10 :b 20 :c 30) :c
30
\end{verbatim} Common Lisp contains several other data structures for mapping keywords or numbers to values, such
as \emph{arrays} and \emph{hash tables}. But for relatively short lists, and especially for rapid prototyping and testing work, plists
can be useful. Plists can also be written and read (i.e. saved and restored) to and from plain text files
in your filesystem, in a very natural way.

\subsubsection{Appending Lists}

\label{subsubsec:appendinglists}

The function \texttt{append} takes any number of lists, and returns a new list which results from
appending them together. Like many CL functions, append does not \emph{side-effect}, that is, it simply returns a new list as a return-value, but does not modify its 
arguments in any way:

\begin{verbatim}
 gdl-user> (defparameter my-slides '(introduction welcome lists functions))
 (introduction welcome lists functions)

 gdl-user> (append my-slides '(numbers))
 (introduction welcome lists functions numbers)

 gdl-user> my-slides
 (introduction welcome lists functions)
\end{verbatim}Note that the simple call to \texttt{append} does not affect the variable \texttt{my-slides}. Later we will see how one may alter the value of a variable such as \texttt{my-slides}.

\chapter{Understanding GDL --- Core GDL Syntax}

\label{chap:understandinggdl---coregdlsyntax}



Now that you have a basic grasp of Common Lisp syntax (or, more accurately, \emph{absence} of syntax), we will move directly into the GDL
framework. By using GDL you can formulate most of your engineering and
computing problems in a natural way, without becoming involved in the
complexity of the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).



The GDL product is a commercially available KBE system with
Proprietary licensing.  The Gendl Project is an open-source Common
Lisp library which contains the core language kernel of GDL, and is
licensed under the terms of the Affero Gnu Public License. The core
GDL language is a proposed standard for a vendor-neutral KBE
language.



As discussed in the previous chapter, GDL is based on and
is a superset of ANSI Common Lisp. Because ANSI CL is unencumbered and
is an open standard, with several commercial and free implementations, it
is a good wager that applications written in it will continue to be
usable for the balance of this century, and beyond. Many commercial 
products have a shelf life only until a new product comes along. Being
based in ANSI Common Lisp ensures GDL's permanence.



\section{Defining a Working Package}

\label{sec:definingaworkingpackage}



In Common Lisp, \emph{packages} are a mechanism to separate symbols into
namespaces. Using packages it is possible to avoid naming conflicts in
large projects. Consider this analogy: in the United States, telephone
numbers consist of a three-digit area code and a seven-digit
number. The same seven-digit number can occur in two or more separate
area codes, without causing a conflict.



The macro \texttt{gdl:define-package}is used to set up a new working package in GDL.



Example:

\begin{verbatim}(gdl:define-package :yoyodyne)
\end{verbatim} will establish a new package called \texttt{:yoyodyne} which has all the GDL operators available.



The \texttt{:gdl-user} package is an empty, pre-defined package for your use if
you do not wish to make a new package just for scratch work.



For real projects it is recommended that you make and work in your own
GDL package, defined as above with \texttt{gdl:define-package}.



\emph{Notes for advanced users:}Packages defined with \texttt{gdl:define-package} will implicitly \emph{use} the \texttt{:gdl} package and the \texttt{:common-lisp} package, so you will have access to all exported symbols
  in these packages without prefixing them with their package name.

  You may extend this behavior, by calling \texttt{gdl:define-package} and adding additional packages to use with \texttt{(:use ...)}.  For example, if  you want to work in a package with access to GDL operators,
 Common Lisp operators, and symbols from the \texttt{:cl-json} package \footnote{CL-JSON is a free third-party library for handling JSON format, a common data format used 
for Internet applications.}, you could set it up as follows:

\begin{verbatim} (ql:quickload :cl-json)
 (gdl:define-package :yoyodyne (:use :cl-json))
\end{verbatim}. the first form ensures that the cl-json code module is actually  fetched and loaded. The second form
defines a package with the \texttt{:cl-json} operators available to it.



\section{Define-Object}

\label{sec:define-object}

\index{objects!defining}\emph{\index{Define-object}Define-object} is the basic macro for defining objects in GDL. An object 
definition maps directly into a Lisp (CLOS) class definition. 

The \texttt{define-object} macro takes three basic arguments:

\begin{itemize}

\item a \emph{name}, which is a symbol;

\item a \emph{\index{mixin-list}mixin-list}, which is a list of symbols naming other objects from which the current object 
will inherit characteristics;

\item a \emph{\index{specification-plist}specification-plist}, which is spliced in (i.e.\ doesn't have its own surrounding 
parentheses) after the mixin-list, and describes
the object model by specifying properties of the object (messages, contained objects, etc.)
The specification-plist typically makes up the bulk of the object definition.

\end{itemize}



Here are descriptions of the most common keywords making up the specification-plist:

\begin{description}

\item [\index{input-slots}input-slots]
specify information to be passed into the object instance when it is created.

\item [\index{computed-slots}computed-slots]
are really cached methods, with expressions to compute and return a value.

\item [\index{objects}objects]
specify other instances to be ``contained'' within this instance.

\item [\index{functions}functions]
are (uncached) functions ``of'' the object, i.e.\ they
operate just as normal CL functions, and accept arguments just like
normal CL functions, with the added feature that you can also use \emph{the} referencing, to refer to messages or reference chains
	  which are available to the current object.

\end{description}

Figure 
\ref{fig:object-hello} shows a simple example, which contains two input-slots, \texttt{first-name} and \texttt{last-name}, and a single computed-slot, \texttt{greeting}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}


 (define-object hello ()
   :input-slots (first-name last-name)

   :computed-slots 
   ((greeting (format nil "Hello, ~a ~a!!" 
                     (the first-name) 
                     (the last-name)))))

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Example of Simple Object Definition}

\label{fig:object-hello}

\end{figure}
As you can see, a GDL Object is analogous in some ways to a \texttt{defun}, where the input-slots are like arguments to the function,
and the computed-slots are like return-values. But seen another way,
each slot in a GDL object serves as function in its own right.

The referencing macro \texttt{\index{the}the} shadows CL's \texttt{the} (which is a seldom-used type declaration operator). \texttt{The} in GDL is a macro which is used to reference the value of other messages 
within the same object or within contained objects. In the above example, we are using \texttt{the} to refer to the values of the messages (input-slots) named \texttt{first-name} and \texttt{last-name}. 

Note that messages used with \texttt{the} are given as symbols. These symbols are unaffected by the current Lisp \texttt{*package*}, so they can be specified either as plain unquoted symbols or as keyword
symbols (i.e.\ preceded by a colon), and the \texttt{the} macro will process them appropriately.

\section{Making Instances and Sending Messages}

\label{sec:makinginstancesandsendingmessages}

Once we have defined an object, such as the example above, we can use
the constructor function \texttt{\index{make-object}make-object} in order to create an \emph{instance} of it. This function is very similar to the CLOS \texttt{\index{make-instance}make-instance} function. Here we create an instance of \texttt{hello} with specified values for \texttt{first-name} and \texttt{last-name} (the required input-slots), and assign this instance as the value of the symbol \texttt{my-instance}:

\begin{verbatim}
 GDL-USER(16): (setq my-instance
                 (make-object 'hello :first-name "John" 
                                     :last-name "Doe"))
 #<HELLO @ #x218f39c2>
\end{verbatim}Note that keyword symbols are used to ``tag'' the input values. And the return-value of \emph{make-object} is an instance of class \texttt{hello}. Now that we have an instance, we can use the operator \texttt{\index{the-object}the-object} to send messages to this instance:

\begin{verbatim}
 GDL-USER(17): (the-object my-instance greeting)
 "Hello, John Doe!!"
\end{verbatim}\texttt{The-object} is similar to \texttt{the}, but as its first argument it takes an expression which evaluates to an
object instance. \texttt{The}, by contrast, assumes that the object instance is the lexical variable \texttt{\index{self}self}, which is automatically set within the lexical context of a \texttt{define-object}.

Like \texttt{the}, \texttt{the-object} evaluates all but the first of its arguments as package-immune symbols,
so although keyword symbols may be used, this is not a requirement, and plain,
unquoted symbols will work just fine.

For convenience, you can also set \texttt{self} manually at the CL Command Prompt, and use \texttt{the} instead of \texttt{the-object} for referencing:

\begin{verbatim}
 GDL-USER(18): (setq self 
                 (make-object 'hello :first-name "John" 
                                     :last-name "Doe"))
 #<HELLO @ #x218f406a>

 GDL-USER(19): (the greeting)
 "Hello, John Doe!!"
\end{verbatim}In actual fact, \texttt{(the ...)} simply expands into \texttt{(the-object self ...)}.

\section{Objects}

\label{sec:objects}

\index{objects}\index{containment!object}\index{objects!child}\index{objects!contained}The \texttt{:objects} keyword specifies a list of ``contained'' instances,
where each instance is considered to be a ``child'' object of the current
object. Each child object is of a specified type, which itself must be defined
with \texttt{define-object} before the child object can be instantiated.

Inputs to each instance are specified as a plist of keywords and
value expressions, spliced in after the object's name and type
specification. These inputs must match the inputs protocol (i.e.\ the input-slots)
of the object being instantiated. Figure 
\ref{fig:object-city} shows an example of an object which contains some child objects.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}


 (define-object city ()
   :computed-slots
   ((total-water-usage (+ (the hotel water-usage)
                          (the bank water-usage))))
   :objects
   ((hotel :type 'hotel
           :size :large)
    (bank  :type 'bank
           :size :medium)))

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Object Containing Child Objects}

\label{fig:object-city}

\end{figure}
In this example, \texttt{hotel} and \texttt{bank} are presumed to be already (or soon to be) defined as objects themselves, 
which each answer the \texttt{water-usage} message. The \emph{\index{reference chains}reference chains}:

\begin{verbatim}(the hotel water-usage)
\end{verbatim} and 

\begin{verbatim}(the bank water-usage)
\end{verbatim} provide the mechanism to access messages within the child object instances.

These child objects become instantiated \emph{on demand}, which means that the first time these instances, or any of their messages,
are referenced, the actual instance will be created \emph{and} cached for future reference.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}


 (defparameter *presidents-data*
     '((:name 
        "Carter"
        :term 1976)
       (:name "Reagan"
        :term 1980)
       (:name "Bush"
        :term 1988)
       (:name "Clinton"
        :term 1992)))
       
 (define-object presidents-container ()

   :input-slots
   ((data *presidents-data*))

   :objects
   ((presidents :type 'president
                :sequence (:size (length (the data)))
                :name (getf (nth (the-child index) (the data)) :name)
                :term (getf (nth (the-child index) (the data)) :term))))

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Sample Data and Object Definition to Contain U.S. Presidents}

\label{fig:object-presidents-container}

\end{figure}


\section{Sequences of Objects and Input-slots with a Default Expression}

\label{sec:sequencesofobjectsandinput-slotswithadefaultexpression}

Objects may be \emph{sequenced}\index{Objects!sequenced}\index{sequences}\index{object sequences}, to specify, in effect, an array or list of object instances. The most
common type of sequence is called a \emph{fixed size} sequence. See Figure 
\ref{fig:object-presidents-container} for an example of an object which contains a sequenced set
of instances representing successive U.S. presidents. Each member of
the sequenced set is fed inputs from a list of plists, which simulates
a relational database table (essentially a ``list of rows'').
        
Note the following from this example:

\begin{itemize}

\item In order to sequence an object, the input keyword \texttt{:sequence} is added, with a list consisting of the keyword \texttt{\index{:size}:size} followed by an expression which must evaluate to a number.

\item In the input-slots, \texttt{data} is specified together with a default expression. Used this way, 
input-slots function as a hybrid of computed-slots and input-slots, allowing a \emph{default expression} as with computed-slots, but allowing a value to be passed in on 
instantiation or from the parent, as with an input-slot which has no default expression. 
A passed-in value will override the default expression.

\end{itemize}



\section{Summary}

\label{sec:summary}

This chapter has provided an introduction to the core GDL
syntax. Following chapters will cover more specialized aspects
of the GDL language, introducing additional Common Lisp concepts as they are
required along the way.

\chapter{The Tasty Development Environment}

\label{chap:thetastydevelopmentenvironment}



\emph{Tasty}\footnote{``Tasty'' is an acronym of acronyms - it stands
for TAtu with STYle (sheets), where tatu comes from Testing And
Tracking Utility.} is a web based testing and tracking utility. Note that Tasty is
designed for developers of GDL applications --- it is not intended
as an end-user application interface (see Chapter 
\ref{chap:customuserinterfacesingdl} for the recommended steps to create end-user interfaces).



Tasty allows you to visualize and inspect any object defined
in GDL, which mixes at least \texttt{base-object} into the definition of its root\footnote{base-object is the core mixin for all geometric
objects and gives them a coordinate system, length, width, and
height. This restriction in tasty will be eliminated in a future GDL
release so the user will be able to instantiate non-geometric
root-level objects in tasty as well, for example to inspect objects
which generate a web page but no geometry.}



First, make sure you have compiled and loaded the code for
the Chapter 5 examples, contained in 

\begin{verbatim}.../src/documentation/tutorial/examples/chapter-5/
\end{verbatim} in your GDL distribution. If you are not sure how to do this,
temporarily leave this section and review Chapter 
\ref{chap:basicoperationofthegdlenvironment}, and then return.



Now you should have the Chapter 5 example definitions
compiled and loaded into the system. To access Tasty, point your web
browser to the URL in figure
\ref{fig:tasty-toplevel-url}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}
 http://<host>:<port>/tasty

 ;; for example:

 http://localhost:9000/tasty
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Web Browser address for Tasty development environment}

\label{fig:tasty-toplevel-url}

\end{figure}
This will produce the start-up page, as seen in Figure 
\ref{fig:tasty-startup}\footnote{This page may look slightly different, e.g. different
icon images, depending on your specific GDL version.}. To access an instance of a specific object definition,
you specify the class package and the object type, separated by a
colon (``:'') (or a double-colon (``::'') in the event the symbol
naming the type is not exported from the package). For example,
consider the simple \texttt{tower1} definition in Figure 
\ref{fig:tower1-code}. This definition is in the \texttt{:chapter-5} package. Consequently, the specification will be \texttt{chapter-5:tower1}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{../images/tasty-start.png}
\end{center}

\caption{Tasty start-up}

\label{fig:tasty-startup}

\end{figure}


Note that if the \texttt{assembly} symbol had not been exported from the \texttt{:chapter-5} package, then a double-colon would have been needed: \texttt{chapter-5::tower1}\footnote{use of a double-colon indicates dubious coding
practice, because it means that the code in quesion is accessing the
``internals'' or ``guts'' of another package, which may not have been
the intent of that other package's designer.}



After you specify the class package and the object type and press the
``browse'' button, the browser will produce the utility interface
with an instance of the specified type (see figure 
\ref{fig:tastyshockabsorberpre}.



The utility interface by default is composed of three toolbars and
three view frames (tree frame, inspector frame and viewport frame
``graphical view port'').


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=5in]{../images/tasty-shock-absorber-pre.pdf}
\end{center}

\caption{Tasty Interface}

\label{fig:tastyshockabsorberpre}

\end{figure}


\subsection{The Toolbars}

\label{subsec:thetoolbars}



The first toolbar consists of two ``tabs'' which allow the
user to select between the display of the application itself or the
GDL reference documentation.



The second toolbar is designed to select various ``click modes'' for
objects and graphical viewing, and to customize the interface in other
ways. It hosts five menus: edit, tree, view, windows and
help\footnote{A File menu will be added in a future release, to
facilitate saving and restoring of instance ``snapshots'' --- at
present, this can be done programmatically.}.



The \emph{tree menu} allows the user to customize the ``click mode'' of the
mouse (or ``tap mode'' for other pointing device) for objects in the
tree, inspector, or viewport frames. The behavior follows the \emph{select-and-match} behavior -- you first \emph{select} a mode of operation with one of the buttons or menu items, 
then \emph{match} that mode to any object in the tree frame or inspector frame by
left-clicking (or tapping). These modes are as follows:



\begin{itemize}

\item 
\underline{Tree: Graphical modes}

\begin{description}

\item [Add Node (AN)]
Node in graphics viewport

\item [Add Leaves (AL)]
Add Leaves in graphics viewport

\item [Add Leaves indiv. (AL*)]
Add Leaves individually (so they can be deleted individually).

\item [Draw Node (DN)]
Draw Node in graphics view port (replacing any existing).

\item [Draw Leaves (DL)]
Draw Leaves in graphics view port (replacing any existing).

\item [Clear Leaves (DL)]
Delete Leaves

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{Tree: Inspect \& debug modes}

\begin{description}

\item [Inspect object (I)]
Inspect (make the inspector frame to show the selected object).

\item [Set self to Object (B)]
Sets a global \texttt{self} variable to the selected object, so you can interact by sending messages to the object at the command prompt e.g. by typing \texttt{(the length)} or \texttt{(the children)}.

\item [Set Root to Object (SR)]
Set displayed root in Tasty tree to selected object.

\item [Up Root (UR!)]
Set displayed root in Tasty tree up one level (this is grayed out if already on root).

\item [Reset Root (RR!)]
Reset displayed root in Tasty to to the true root of the tree (this is grayed out if already on root).

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{Tree: frame navigation modes}

\begin{description}

\item [Expand to Leaves (L)]
Nodes expand to their deepest leaves when clicked. 

\item [Expand to Children (C)]
Nodes expand to their direct children when clicked.

\item [Auto Close (A)]
When any node is clicked to expand, all other nodes close automatically.

\item [Remember State (R)]
Nodes expand to their previously expanded state when clicked.

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{View: Viewport Actions}

\begin{description}

\item [Fit to Window!]
Fits to the graphics viewport size the displayed objects (use after a Zoom)

\item [Clear View! (CL!)]
Clear all the objects displayed in the graphics viewport.

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{View: Image Format}

\begin{description}

\item [PNG]
Sets the displayed format in the graphics viewport to PNG (raster image with 
        isoparametric curves for surfaces and brep faces).

\item [JPEG]
Sets the displayed format in the graphics viewport to JPEG
         (raster image with isoparametric curves for surfaces and brep faces).

\item [VRML/X3D]
Sets the displayed format in the graphics viewport to
             VRML with default lighting and viewpoint (these can be changed
             programmatically). This requires a compatible plugin such as BS Contact

\item [X3DOM]
This experimental mode sets the displayed format in the graphics viewport to use the x3dom.js Javascript library,
which attempts to render X3D format directly in-browser without the need for plugins. This works best in WebGL-enabled
browsers such as a recent version of Google Chrome\footnote{Currently, it is necessary to ``Reload'' or
	   ``Refresh'' the browser window to display the geometry in
	   this mode.}.

\item [SVG/VML]
Sets the displayed format in the graphics viewport to SVG/VML\footnote{For complex objects with many display curves,
            SVG/VML can overwhelm the JavaScript engine in the web
            browser. Use PNG for these cases.}, which is a vector graphics image format displaying 
            isoparametric curves for surfaces and brep faces.

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{View: Click Modes}

\begin{description}

\item [Zoom in]
Sets the mouse left-click in the graphics viewport to zoom in.

\item [Zoom out]
Sets the mouse left-click in the graphics viewport to zoom out.

\item [Measure distance]
Calculates the distance between two selected points from the graphics viewport.

\item [Get coordinates]
Displays the coordinates of the selected point from the graphics viewport.

\item [Select Object]
Allows the user to select an object from the graphics
                  viewport (currently works for displayed curves and
                  in SVG/VML mode only).

\end{description}



\item 
\underline{View: Perspective}

\begin{description}

\item [Trimetric]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to trimetric.

\item [Front]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Front (negative Y axis).

\item [Rear]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Rear (positive Y axis).

\item [Left]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Left (negative X axis).

\item [Right]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Right (positive X axis).

\item [Top]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Top (positive Z axis).

\item [Bottom]
Sets the displayed perspective in the graphics viewport to Bottom (negative Z axis).

\end{description}



\end{itemize}



The third toolbar hosts the most frequently used
buttons. These buttons have tooltips which will pop up when you hover
the mouse over them. However, these buttons are found in the second
toolbar as well, except for line thickness and color buttons. The line
thickness and color buttons\footnote{the design of the line thickness and color buttons is
being refined and may appear different in your installation.} expand and contract when clicked, and allows the user to
select a desired line thickness and color for the objects displayed in
the graphics viewport.



\subsection{View Frames}

\label{subsec:viewframes}



The \emph{tree frame} contains a hierarchical representation of your defined
object. For example for the tower assembly this will be as depicted in
figure 
\ref{fig:tree-twisty-tower}



To draw the graphics (geometry) for the shock-absorber
leaf-level objects, you can select the ``Add Leaves (AL)'' item from
the Tree menu, then click the desired leaf to be displayed from the
tree. Alternatively, you can select the ``rapid'' button from third
toolbar which is symbolized by a pencil icon. Because this
operation (draw leaves) is frequently used, the operation is directly
available as a tooltip which will pop up when you hover the mouse over
any leaf or node in the tree.



The ``on the fly'' feature is available also for ``inspect
object,'' as the second icon when you hover the mouse over a leaf or
node.



The ``inspector'' frame allows the user to inspect (and in
some cases modify) the object instance being inspected.



For example, we can make the \texttt{number-of-blocks} of the tower to be ``settable,'' by adding the keyword \texttt{:settable} after its default expression (please look ahead to Chapter 
\ref{chap:advancedgendl} if you are interested in more details on this  GDL
syntax). We will also pass the number-of-blocks as the :size of the  \texttt{blocks} sequence, rather than using a hard-coded value as
previously. The new assembly definition is now:



In this new version of the tower, the number-of-blocks is a
settable slot, and its value can be modified (i.e. ``bashed'') as
desired, either programmatically from the command-line, in an end-user
application, or from the Tasty environment.



To modify the value in Tasty: select ``Inspect'' mode from the Tree
menu, then select the root of the \texttt{assembly} tree to set the inspector on that object (see Figure 
\ref{fig:tasty-inspector}). Once the inspector is displaying this object, it is
possible to expand its settable slots by clicking on the ``Show
Settables!''  link. (use the ``X'' link to collapse the settable slots
view). When the settable slots area is open, the user may set the
values as desired by inputting the new value and pressing the OK
button (see Figure 
\ref{fig:tasty-s-slots}).



\chapter{Working with Geometry in GDL}

\label{chap:workingwithgeometryingdl}



Although GDL's uses include general-purpose computing, one of
  its particular strong points is generating geometry and processing
  geometric entities in various ways. Geometric capabilities are
  provided by a library of \emph{low-level primitives}, or LLPs. LLPs are pre-defined GDL objects which you can
	extend by ``mixing in'' with your own definitions, and/or
	instantiate as child objects in your definitions.



The names of the geometric LLPs are in the \texttt{:geom-base} package, and here are some examples:

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{base-coordinate-system} provides an empty 3D Cartesian coordinate system\footnote{\texttt{base-coordinate-system} is also known by its legacy name \texttt{base-object}.}

\item Simple 2-dimensional primitives include \texttt{line}, \texttt{arc}, and \texttt{ellipse}.

\item Simple 3-dimensional primitives include \texttt{box}, \texttt{sphere}, and \texttt{cylinder}.

\item Advanced 3-dimensional primitives (which depend on optional add-on Geometry Kernel module) include \texttt{b-spline-curve}, \texttt{b-spline-surface}, and \texttt{merged-solid}.

\end{itemize}

This chapter will cover the default coordinate system of GDL as well as the built-in simple 2D and 3D LLPs. Chapter 
\ref{chap:workingwithsurfacesandsolids} will cover the advanced Surfaces and Solids primitives.



\section{The Default Coordinate System in GDL}

\label{sec:thedefaultcoordinatesystemingdl}



GDL's default coordinate system comes with the standard mixin \texttt{base-coordinate-system} and represents a standard three-dimensional Cartesian
	 Coordinate system with X, Y, and Z dimensions.

\section{Building a Geometric GDL Model from LLPs}

\label{sec:buildingageometricgdlmodelfromllps}

The simplest geometric entity in GDL is a \texttt{box}, and in fact all entities are associated with an imaginary \emph{reference box} which shares the same slots as a normal box. The \texttt{box} primitive type in GDL inherits its inputs from \texttt{base-coordinate-system}, and the fundamental inputs are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{center} Default: \texttt{\#(0.0 0.0 0.0)}

\item \texttt{orientation} Default: \texttt{nil}

\item \texttt{height} Default: \texttt{0}

\item \texttt{length} Default: \texttt{0}

\item \texttt{width} Default: \texttt{0}

\label{chap:customuserinterfacesingdl}



Another of the strengths of GDL is the ability to create custom
web-based user interfaces. GDL contains a built-in web server and
supports the creation of generative \emph{web-based} user interfaces\footnote{GDL does not contain support for native desktop
GUI applications. Although the host Common Lisp
environment (e.g. Allegro CL or LispWorks) may contain a GUI builder
and Integrated Development Environment, and you are free to use these,
GDL does not provide specific support for them.}. Using the same \texttt{define-object} syntax which you have already encountered, you can define
web pages, sections of web pages, and \emph{form control} elements such as type-in fields, checkboxes, and choice
lists [using this capability does require a basic working knowledge of
the HTML language].\footnote{We will not cover HTML in this manual, but
plentiful resources are available online and in print.}.



Any web extensions such as custom JavaScript and JavaScript libraries
can also be used, as with any standard web application.



With the primitive objects and functions in its \texttt{:gwl} package, GDL supports both the traditional ``Web 1.0''
interfaces (with fillout forms, page submittal, and complete page
refresh) as well as so-called ``Web 2.0'' interaction with AJAX.



\section{Package and Environment for Web Development}

\label{sec:packageandenvironmentforwebdevelopment}



Similarly to \texttt{gdl:define-package}, you can use \texttt{gwl:define-package} in order to create a working package which has
access to the symbols you will need for building a web application (in
addition to all the other GDL symbols).



The \texttt{:gwl-user} package is pre-defined and may be used for practice
work. For real projects, you should define your own package using \texttt{gwl:define-package}.



The acronym ``GWL'' stands for Generative Web Language,
which is not in fact a separate language from GDL itself, but rather
is a set of primitive objects and functions available with GDL for
building web applications. The YADD reference documentation for
package ``Generative Web Language'' provides detailed specifications
for all the primitive objects and functions.



\section{Traditional Web Pages and Applications}

\label{sec:traditionalwebpagesandapplications}



To make a GDL object presentable as a web page, the following two
steps are needed:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Mix \texttt{base-html-sheet} into the object definition.

\item define a GDL function called \texttt{main-sheet} within the object definition.

\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{main-sheet} function should return valid
HTML for the page. The easiest way to produce HTML is with the use of
an HTML generating library, such as \href{http://weitz.de/cl-who}{CL-WHO}\footnote{http://weitz.de/cl-who} or \href{http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/aserve/htmlgen.html}{HTMLGen}\footnote{http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/current/doc/aserve/htmlgen.html}, both of which are built into GDL.



For our examples we will use cl-who, which is currently the
standard default HTML generating library used internally by
GDL. Here we will make note of the major features of cl-who while
introducing the examples; for complete documentation on cl-who, please
visit the page at Edi Weitz' website linked above.



\subsection{A Simple Static Page Example}

\label{subsec:asimplestaticpageexample}



In Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-1}, GWL convenience macro \texttt{with-cl-who} is used; this sets up a standard default environment for outputting HTML 
within a GWL application.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}(in-package :gwl-user)

(define-object president (base-html-sheet)
  :input-slots
  ((name "Carter") (term 1976) (table-border 1))

  :functions
  ((write-html-sheet
    () (with-cl-who (:indent t)
         (:html (:head (:title (fmt "Info on President: ~a" 
                                    (the name))))
                (:body ((:table :border (the table-border))
                        (:tr (:th "Name") (:th "Term"))
                        (:tr (:td (str (the name))) 
                             (:td (str (the term)))))))))))
;;
;; Access the above example with 
;; http://localhost:9000/make?object=gwl-user::president
;;

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}
\fbox{\usebox{\boxedverb}}

\caption{Simple Static Page Example}

\label{fig:gwl-1}

\end{figure}




The code in Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-1} produces HTML output as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-1-html} which looks similar to Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-1-image} in a web browser.
\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{verbatim}

  <head>

    </title>

    <table border="1">
      <tr> <th>Name</th>
           <th>Term</th>
      </tr>
      <tr> <td>Carter</td>
           <td>1976</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body></html>

\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{lrbox}

\label{fig:gwl-1-image}

\end{figure}




Several important concepts are packed into this example. Note the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Our convenience macro \texttt{with-cl-who} is used to wrap the native \texttt{with-html-output} macro which comes with the cl-who library.

\item We use the keyword argument \texttt{:indent t} in order to pretty-print the generated HTML. This does
     not affect the browser display but can make the generated HTML
     easier to read and debug. This option should be left as nil (the
     default) for production deployments.

\item The \texttt{fmt} symbol has special meaning
      within the cl-who environment and works the same as a Common
      Lisp \texttt{(format nil ...)}, in order to evaluate a format
      string together with matching arguments, and produce a string at
      runtime.

\item The \texttt{str} symbol has special meaning
      within the cl-who environment and works by evaluating an
      expression at runtime to return a string or other printable
      object, which is then included at that point in the HTML output.

\item Expressions within the \texttt{body} of an
      HTML tag have to be evaluated, usually by use of the \texttt{fmt} or \texttt{str} in cl-who.  There are three examples of this in the
      above sample: one \texttt{fmt} and two \texttt{str}.

\item Expressions within a \emph{tag attribute} are always evaluated automatically, and so do 
\textbf{not} require a \texttt{str} or other special symbol to force evaluation at
      runtime. Tag attributes in HTML (or XML) are represented as a
      plist spliced in after a tag name, wrapped in extra parentheses
      around the tag name. In the sample above, the \texttt{:border (the table-border)} is an example of a tag attribute on the \texttt{:table} tag. Notice that the expression \texttt{(the table-border)} does not need \texttt{str} in order to be evaluated - it gets evaluated automatically.

\item In cl-who, if a tag attribute evaluates to \texttt{nil}, then that tag attribute will be left out of the output
      completely. For example if \texttt{(the table-border)} evaluates to nil, then the \texttt{:table} tag will be outputted without any attributes at
      all. This is a convenient way to conditionalize tag
      attributes.

\item The URL \texttt{http://localhost:9000/make?object=gwl-user::president} is published automatically based on the package and
      name of the object definition. When you visit this URL, the
      response is redirected to a unique URL identified by
      a \emph{session ID}. This ensures that each user to your
      application site will see their own specific instance of the
      page object. The session ID is constructed from a combination of
      the current date and time, along with a pseudo-random
      number.

\end{itemize}





\subsection{A Simple Dynamic Page which Mixes HTML and Common Lisp/GDL}

\label{subsec:asimpledynamicpagewhichmixeshtmlandcommonlisp/gdl}



Within the cl-who environment it is possible to include any standard
Common Lisp structures such as \texttt{let}, \texttt{dolist} , \texttt{dotimes}, etc, which accept a \emph{body} of code. The requirement is that any internal code body
	  must be wrapped in a list beginning with the special symbol \texttt{htm}, which has meaning to cl-who. 


\begin{figure}
\begin{lrbox}{\boxedverb}

                     (list :name "Carter"
                           :term 1976)

            (dolist (president (the presidents))
              (htm

\end{center}

\caption{Mixing Static HTML and Dynamic Content}

\label{fig:gwl-2-image}

\end{figure}


The example in Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-2}  uses this technique to output an HTML table row for each ``row'' of data in a list of lists.
The output looks similar to Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-2-image} in a web browser.



Note the following from this example:

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{title} is a \texttt{let} variable, so we use \texttt{(str title)} to evaluate it as a string. We do not use \texttt{(str (the title))} because \texttt{title} is a local variable and not a message (i.e. slot) in the object.

\item Inside the \texttt{dolist}, we ``drop back into'' HTML mode using the \texttt{htm} operator.

\end{itemize}





\subsection{Linking to Multiple Pages}

\label{subsec:linkingtomultiplepages}



The base-html-sheet mixin provides a \texttt{self-link} message for the purpose of generating a hyperlink to that
page. Typically you will have a ``parent'' page object which links to
its ``child'' pages, but GDL pages can link to other pages anywhere
in the GDL tree\footnote{In order for dependency-tracking to work
properly, the pages must all belong to the same tree, i.e. they must
share a common root object.}.

 Note the following from this example:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \texttt{write-self-link} message is a function which can take a keyword argument
   of \texttt{:display-string}. This string is used for the actual hyperlink text.

\item There is a \texttt{write-back-link} message which similarly can take a keyword argument of \texttt{:display-string}. This generates a link back to \texttt{(the return-object)} which, by default in base-html-sheet, is \texttt{(the parent).}

\end{itemize}





\subsection{Form Controls and Fillout-Forms}

\label{subsec:formcontrolsandfillout-forms}



\subsubsection{Form Controls}

\label{subsubsec:formcontrols}



GDL provides a set of primitives useful for generating the
       standard HTML form-controls\footnote{http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html} such as text, checkbox, radio, submit, menu, etc. These
            should be instantiated as child objects in the page, then
            included in the HTML for the page
            using \texttt{str} within an
            HTML \texttt{form} tag (see next section).



The form-controls provided by GDL are documented in YADD accessible with 

\begin{verbatim}http://localhost:9000/yadd
\end{verbatim} and in Chapter 
\ref{chap:gdlreference} of this Manual. Examples of 
available form-controls are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{text-form-control}

\item \texttt{checkbox-form-control}

\item \texttt{menu-form-control}

\item \texttt{radio-form-control}

\item \texttt{text-form-control}

\item \texttt{button-form-control}

\end{itemize}





These form-controls are customizable by mixing them into
	   your own specific form-controls (although this is often not
	   necessary). New form-controls such as for numbers, dates,
	   etc will soon be added to correspond to latest HTML
	   standards.



\subsubsection{Fillout Forms}

\label{subsubsec:filloutforms}



A traditional web application must enclose form controls inside a \texttt{form} tag and specify an \texttt{action} (a web URL) to receive and respond to the 
form submission. The response will cause the entire page to refresh with
a new page. In GDL, such a form can be generated by wrapping the layout
of the form controls within the \texttt{with-html-form} macro.

\section{Partial Page Updates with gdlAjax}

\label{sec:partialpageupdateswithgdlajax}



\index{AJAX}AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax\_(programming)}, and allows for more interactive web applications which
respond to user events by updating only part of the web page. The
``Asynchronous'' in Ajax refers to a web page's ability to continue
interacting while one part of the page is being updated by a server
response. Requests need not be Asynchronous, they can also be
Synchronous (``SJAX''), which would cause the web browser to block
execution of any other tasks while the request is being carried
out. The ``XML'' refers to the format of the data that is typically
returned from an AJAX request.



GDL contains a simple framework referred to as \emph{gdlAjax} which supports a uniquely convenient and generative
approach to AJAX (and SJAX). With gdlAjax, you use standard GDL
object definitions and child objects in order to model the web page
and the sections of the page, and the dependency tracking engine which
is built into GDL automatically keeps track of which sections of the
page need to be updated after a request.



Moreover, the state of the internal GDL model which
represents the page and the page sections is kept identical to the
displayed state of the page. This means that if the user hits the
``Refresh'' button in the browser, the state of the page will remain
unchanged. This ability is not present in some other Ajax
frameworks.



\subsection{Steps to Create a gdlAjax Application}

\label{subsec:stepstocreateagdlajaxapplication}



Initially, it is important to understand that the
fundamentals from the previous section on Standard Web Applications
still apply for gdlAjax applications --- that is, HTML generation,
page linking, etc. These techniques will all still work in a gdlAjax
application.



To produce a gdlAjax application involves three main differences from
a standard web application:

\begin{enumerate}

\item You mix in \texttt{base-ajax-sheet} instead of \texttt{base-html-sheet}. \texttt{base-ajax-sheet} mixes in \texttt{base-html-sheet}, so it will still provide all the functionality of that
   mixin. In fact, you can use \texttt{base-ajax-sheet} in standard web applications and you won't notice any difference if you do
    everything else the same.

\item Instead of a \texttt{write-html-sheet} message, you specify a \texttt{main-sheet-body} message. The \texttt{main-sheet-body}  can be a computed-slot or GDL function,
    and unlike the \texttt{write-html-sheet} message, it should
    simply return a string, not send output to a stream. Also, it only
    fills in the body of the page --- everything between the <body>
    and </body> tags. The head tag of the page is filled in
    automatically and can be customized in various ways.

\item Any sections of the page which you want to be able
      to change themselves in response to an Ajax call must be made
      into separate page sections, or ``sheet sections,'' and the HTML
      for their \texttt{main-div} included in the main page's \texttt{main-sheet-body} by use of cl-who's \texttt{str} directive.

\end{enumerate}

\caption{Partial Page Updates with GdlAjax}

\label{fig:gwl-4}

\end{figure}




Note the following from the example in Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-4}:

\begin{itemize}

\item We mix in \texttt{base-ajax-sheet} and specify a \texttt{main-sheet-body} slot, which uses \texttt{with-cl-who-string} to compute a string
                   of HTML. This approach is also easier to debug,
                   since the \texttt{main-sheet-body} string
                   can be evaluated in the tasty inspector or at the
                   command-line.

\item We use \texttt{str} to include the string for the main page
        section (called \texttt{main-section} in this example) into the \texttt{main-sheet-body}.

\item In the \texttt{main-section}, we also
        use \texttt{str} to include the html-string for each of
        three form-controls. We have provided a form control for the
        table border, the table padding, and the revenue year to look
        up.

\item The only page section in this example is \texttt{(the main-section)}. This is defined as a child object, and has its \texttt{inner-html} computed in the parent and passed in as an input. The \texttt{sheet-section} will automatically compute a \texttt{main-div} message based on the \texttt{inner-html} that we are passing in. The \texttt{main-div} is simply the \texttt{inner-html}, wrapped with
               an HTML DIV (i.e. ``division'') tag which contains a unique
               identifier for this section, derived from the root-path
               to the GDL object in the in tree which represents the
               sheet section.

\item We introduce the CL function \texttt{gwl:publish-gwl-app}, which makes available a simplified URL for visiting an instance of this
        object in the web browser. In this case, we can access the
        instance using \texttt{http://localhost:9000/revenue-lookup}

\end{itemize}





Notice also the use of \texttt{:ajax-submit-on-change? ...} in each of the form-controls. This directs the gdlAjax
	  system to ``scrape'' the values of these form controls
	  and ``bash'' them into the \texttt{value} slot of the corresponding object on the server, whenever
they are changed in the browser. No ``Submit'' button press is
necessary.



It is also possible programmatically to send form-control
      values, and/or call a GDL Function, on the server, by
      using the \texttt{\index{gdl-ajax-call}gdl-ajax-call} GDL function. This function will emit the necessary
	  JavaScript code to use as an event handler, e.g. for an
	  ``onclick'' event. For example, you could have the following snippet somewhere in your page:

\begin{verbatim}((:span :onclick (the (gdl-ajax-call :function-key :restore-defaults!))) "Press Me" )
\end{verbatim}This will produce a piece of text ``Press Me,'' which,
	  when pressed, will have the effect of calling a function named \texttt{restore-defaults!} in the page's object on the server. If the function \texttt{restore-defaults!} is not defined, an error will result. The \texttt{gdl-ajax-call} GDL function can also send arbitrary form-control values
	  to the server by using the \texttt{:form-controls} keyword argument, and listing the relevant form-control objects. The \texttt{gdl-ajax-call} GDL function is fully documented in YADD and the reference appendix.



If for some reason you want to do more than one \texttt{gdl-ajax-call} sequentially, then it is best to use \texttt{gdl-sjax-call} instead. This variant will cause the browser to wait until
	  each call completes, before making the next call. To achieve
	  this, you would want to append the strings together, e.g:

\begin{verbatim}
       ((:span :onclick (string-append (the (gdl-sjax-call ...))  
                                       (the (gdl-sjax-call ...)) 
                                       (the (gdl-sjax-call ...))) ... ))
\end{verbatim}With that said, it is rarely necessary to do these calls
	  sequentially like this, because you can use :form-controls
	  and :function-key simultaneously. As long as your logic
	  works correctly when the form-controls are set before the
	  function is called, then you can group the functions
	  together into a ``wrapper-function,'' and do the whole
	  processing with a single Ajax (or Sjax) call. Normally this
	  would be be the recommended approach whenever it it
	  possible.



\subsection{Including Graphics}

\label{subsec:includinggraphics}



The fundamental mixin or child type to make a graphics viewport is \texttt{base-ajax-graphics-sheet}. This object definition takes several optional input-slots, but the most essential are the \texttt{:display-list-objects} and the \texttt{:display-list-object-roots}. As indicated by their names, you specify a list of nodes to include in
the graphics output with the \texttt{:display-list-objects}, and a list of nodes whose \texttt{leaves} you want to display in the graphics output with the \texttt{:display-list-object-roots}. View controls, rendering format, action to take when clicking on objects, etc, 
can be controlled with other optional input-slots.

The example in Figure

This will produce a web browser output similar to what is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:gwl-5-image}.



Note the following from this example:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \texttt{(:use-raphael? t)} enables raphael for SVG or VML output.

\item The \texttt{:raphael} image-format generates SVG or VML, depending on the browser.

\item We conditionally include development-links for full Update and SetSelf! actions.

\item We include two viewports in the \texttt{main-sheet-body}, elements from a sequence of size 2.

\item In the inputs-section, we use
                  the \texttt{html-string} message from each
                  form-control to display the default
                  decoration (prompt, etc).

\chapter{More Common Lisp for GDL}

\label{chap:morecommonlispforgdl}



\chapter{Advanced GDL}

\label{chap:advancedgdl}



\chapter*{Upgrade Notes}

\label{chap:upgradenotes}

GDL 1580 marked the end of a major branch of GDL development,
and 1581 was actually a major new version, which now has been
supplanted by 1582. 

This addendum lists the typical modifications you will want to
consider for upgrading from GDL 1580 to GDL 1582 or later.

\begin{itemize}

\item (make-gdl-app ..) is now available for 1582. We have
made available an Enterprise Edition of 1582 which includes the
make-gdl-app function, which creates Runtime applications without the
compiler or GDL development facilities.  If you are an Enterprise
licensee, and are ready to release Runtime applications on 1582, and
you have not received information on the Enterprise Edition, please
contact support@genworks.com

\item (register-asdf-systems) and the \texttt{"3rdpty/"} directory are no longer needed or available. Instead, we depend on the Quicklisp
system. Details of Quicklisp are available at \href{http://www.quicklisp.org}. See Section 
\ref{subsec:compilingandloadingasystem} for information about how to use Quicklisp with GDL.

\item There is a system-wide \texttt{gdlinit.cl} in the application directory, and depending on the
       particular release you have, this may have some default
       information which ships with GDL. There is a personal \texttt{gdlinit.cl} in home directory, which you should modify if you want to
       customize anything.

\item Slime debugging is different from the ELI emacs debugger. The main thing to know is 
to press ``a'' or ``q'' to pop out of the current error. Full documentation for the Slime debug mode
is available with the \href{http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Debugger.html}{Slime documentation}.

\item color-themes -- GDL now ships with the Emacs
       color-theme package. You can select a different color theme with \texttt{M-x color-theme-select}. Press [Enter] or middle-mouse on a color theme to apply it.

\item GDL files can now end with \texttt{.lisp} or \texttt{.gdl}. The new \texttt{.gdl} extension will work for emacs Lisp mode and will work with
	 cl-lite, ASDF, and Quicklisp for including source files in application systems. We recommend migrating
to the new \texttt{.gdl} extension for files containing \texttt{define-object}, \texttt{define-format}, and \texttt{define-lens} forms, and any other future toplevel defining forms introduced by GDL, in order to distinguish 
from files containing raw Common Lisp code.

\item in gdlAjax, HTML for a sheet-section is given in the slot called \texttt{inner-html} instead of \texttt{main-view}. This name change was made to clarify what exactly is
	 expected in this slot -- it is the innerHTML of the page
	 division represented by the current sheet-section. If you
	 want to make your code back-compatible with GDL 1580, you can
	 use the following form in place of old occurences of \texttt{main-view}: 

\begin{verbatim}... #+allegro-v8.1 main-view #-allegro-v8.1 inner-html ...
\end{verbatim}

\item (update-gdl ..) is not yet available for 1582. Instead
of updating incrementally with patches, the intention starting with
GDL 1582 is for full GDL releases to be made available approximately
monthly. Less frequent Long Term Maintenance (``LTS'') releases will
also be made available along with a new simpler maintenance patch
system.

extra parentheses around the message in the reference chain and using the index number. But the aggregate itself also supports certain
messages, documented here. One message, \texttt{number-of-elements}, is not listed in the normal messages section because it is 
internal. It can be used, and returns an integer representing the cardinality of the aggregate.

[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{Void}

 Restores all settable-slots in this instance to their default values.




\item [Restore-slot-default!]
\index{Restore-slot-default!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{NIL}

 Restores the value of the given slot to its default, thus ``undoing'' any forcibly set value
in the slot. Any dependent slots in the tree will respond accordingly when they are next demanded.
Note that the slot must be specified as a keyword symbol (i.e. prepended with a colon (``:'')),
otherwise it will be evaluated as a variable according to normal Lisp functional evaluation rules.




\item [Restore-slot-defaults!]
\index{Restore-slot-defaults!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{nil}

 Restores the value of the given slots to their defaults, thus ``undoing'' any forcibly set values
in the slots. Any dependent slots in the tree will respond accordingly when they are next demanded.
Note that the slots must be specified as keyword symbols (i.e. prepended with colons (``:'')),
otherwise they will be evaluated as variables according to normal Lisp functional evaluation rules.




\item [Restore-tree!]
\index{Restore-tree!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{Void}

 Restores all settable-slots in this instance, and recursively in all descendant instances,
to their default values.




\item [Set-slot!]
\index{Set-slot!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{NIL}

 Forcibly sets the value of the given slot to the given value. The slot must be defined
as \texttt{:settable} for this to work properly. Any dependent slots in the tree will
respond accordingly when they are next demanded. Note that the slot must be specified as a keyword
symbol (i.e. prepended with a colon (``:'')), otherwise it will be evaluated as a variable according
to normal Lisp functional evaluation rules.



Note also that this must not be called (either directly or indirectly)
from within the body of a Gendl computed-slot. The caching and
dependency tracking mechanism in Gendl will not work properly if this
is called from the body of a computed-slot, and furthermore a runtime
error will be generated.






\item [Set-slots!]
\index{Set-slots!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{NIL}

 Forcibly sets the value of the given slots to the given values. The slots must be defined
as \texttt{:settable} for this to work properly. Any dependent slots in the tree will
respond accordingly when they are next demanded. Note that the slots must be specified as a keyword
symbols (i.e. prepended with a colon (``:'')), otherwise they will be evaluated as variables according
to normal Lisp functional evaluation rules.

\item [Slot-status]
\index{Slot-status
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{Keyword symbol}

 Describes the current status of the requested slot:


\begin{enumerate}

\item \texttt{:unbound}: it has not yet been demanded (this could mean either
it has never been demanded, or something it depends on has been
modified since the last time it was demanded and eager setting is not enabled).


\item \texttt{:evaluated}: it has been demanded and it is currently bound to the default
value based on the code.


\item \texttt{:set}: (for :settable slots only, which includes all required :input-slots)
it has been modified and is currently bound to the value to which it was explicitly set.


\item \texttt{:toplevel}: (for root-level object only) its value was passed into the root-level
object as a toplevel input at the time of object instantiation.

\end{enumerate}






\item [Update!]
\index{Update!
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{Void}

 Uncaches all cached data in slots and objects throughout the instance
tree from this node, forcing all code to run again the next time values are
demanded. This is useful for updating an existing model or part of an existing
model after making changes and recompiling/reloading the code of the underlying
definitions.  Any set (modified) slot values will, however, be preserved
by the update.




\item [Write-snapshot]
\index{Write-snapshot
[vanilla-mixin*]}\emph{Void}

 Writes a file containing the toplevel inputs and modified settable-slots starting from the root of the
current instance. Typically this file can be read back into the system using the \texttt{read-snapshot} function.

   in any way, so as with base-object, it provides an imaginary
   geometric reference box with a length, width, height, center, and
   orientation.

\underline{Mixins:}} BASE-OBJECT





\begin{description}

\item [
\underline{Description}]


Generic container object for displaying one or more scaled
transformed views of geometric or text-based entities. The contained views are generally 
of type \texttt{base-view}. In a GWL application-mixin, you can include one 
object of this type in the ui-display-list-leaves.

For the PDF output-format, you can also use the cad-output output-function to write the 
drawing as a PDF document. 

Since base-drawing is inherently a 2D object, only the top view (getf *standard-views* :top) 
makes sense for viewing it.

\begin{description}

\item [
\underline{Description}]


Block of text typeset using cl-typesetting. This object
wraps the typeset block as a standard GDL object, so it can be placed in a view and 
positioned according to normal GDL positioning.

You can specify the width, and by default this object will compute its length automatically 
from the typeset content, to fit all the lines of text into the box. Because of this 
computed behavior of the length, the center of the box will not, in general, be in a 
known location compared to the start of the text. Because of this it is recommended
to use :corner, rather than :center, for positioning a base-view which contains
a typeset block. 

In the normal case, if you want a single block in a view on a drawing, you should
make the base-view object have the same width and length as the typeset-block. The
base-view should also probably have :left-margin 0 and :front-margin 0.

\item [
\underline{Description}]


(Note: this documentation will be moved
to the specific docs for the html-format/base-ajax-sheet lens, when 
we have lens documentation working properly)

Produces a standard main-sheet for html-format which includes the
standard GDL Javascript to enable code produced with gdl-ajax-call to
work, and optionally to include the standard JQuery library.

If you want to define your own main-sheet, then there is no use for
base-ajax-sheet, you can just use base-html-sheet. But then you have
to include any needed Javascript yourself, e.g. for gdl-ajax-call
support or jQuery.

The html-format lens for base-ajax-sheet also defines a user hook function,
main-sheet-body, which produces a "No Body has been defined" message by default, 
but which you can fill in your own specific lens to do something useful for the body.

Dave Cooper, Genworks



\item [
\underline{Description}]


This object can be used to represent a single HTML form control. It captures the 
initial default value, some display information such as the label, and all the standard HTML tag attributes
for the tag e.g. INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA. GWL will process the data types according to specific rules,
and validate the typed value according to other default rules. A custom validation-function can also 
be provided by user code. 

Sequences of these objects (with :size, :indices, :matrix, and :radial) are supported.

This facility and its documentation is expected to undergo significant and frequent upgrades in the remainder of GDL 1573 and upcoming 1575.

Current to-do list:



\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Currently this works with normal HTTP form submission and full page reloading. 
We intend to make it work with AJAX and surgical page update as well.



\item 
We intend to provide inputs for all the standard tag attributes for the accompanying LABEL tag for the form control.



\item 
Additional form control elements to be included, to cover all types of form elements specified in current HTML standard from

    http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html\#h-17.2.1

    

\begin{itemize}

\item button-form-control: submit buttons, reset buttons, push buttons.
      

\item checkbox-form-control: checkboxes, radio buttons (multiple of these must be able to have same name)
      

\item menu-form-control: select, along with optgroup and option.
      

\item text-form-control: single-line text input (including masked passwords) and multi-line (TEXTAREA) text input.
      

\item file-form-control: file select for submittal with a form.
      

\item hidden-form-control: input of type hidden.
      

\item object-form-control: (not sure how this is supposed to work yet).
    

\end{itemize}



\end{enumerate}




Also, we have to study and clarify the issue of under what conditions values can possibly take on nil values, 
and what constitutes a required field as opposed to a non-validated field, and whether a blank string on a text
input should be represented as a nil value or as an empty string.

Note that checkbox-form-control and menu-form-control currently get automatically included in the possible-nils.

\item [Validation-function]
\index{Validation-function
[base-form-control]}\emph{Function of one argument}

 The argument will be the submitted form value converted to the proper type.
The return value from this function can be nil, any non-nil value, or a plist with keys :validated-value
and :error. The following behavior applies:


\begin{itemize}

\item  If the function returns nil, error is set to  :unspecified-validation-fail.

\item  If the function returns a plist with keys :validated-value and :error, and if :error is non-nil,
it means the value is not acceptable, the form-controls error message is set to this error (usually a keyword symbol),
and the error string will be appended to the html-string by default. 

\item  If the function returns any other value, then the properly typed submitted form value is considered valid and is used.


\end{itemize}


In the case of an error, the form-control's failed-value message is set to the properly typed submitted form value. If
allow-invalid? is non-nil, then the form-control's value message is also set to this value (i.e. the invalid value is
still accepted, even though a non-nil error is present).
Default is (list :validated-value value :error nil).

\underline{Gdl functions:}}

\begin{description}

\item [After-present!]
\index{After-present!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
the respondent of a form, to do some processing after the respondent's
\texttt{write-html-sheet} function runs to present the object.




\item [After-set!]
\index{After-set!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
the requestor of a form, to do some processing after the requestor's form
values are set into the specified bashee.




\item [Before-present!]
\index{Before-present!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
the respondent of a form, to do some processing before the respondent's
\texttt{write-html-sheet} function runs to present the object. This can be
useful especially for objects which are subclasses of higher-level mixins such as
\texttt{application-mixin} and \texttt{node-mixin}, where you do not have
direct access to the \texttt{write-html-sheet} function and typically only define
the \texttt{model-inputs} function. It is not always reliable to do processing
in the \texttt{model-inputs} function, since some slots which depend on your
intended modifications may already have been evaluated by the time the
\texttt{model-inputs} function runs.




\item [Before-response!]
\index{Before-response!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
a user specialization of base-html-sheet, to do some processing before the
header-plist is evaluated and before the HTTP response is actually initiated.




\item [Before-set!]
\index{Before-set!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
the requestor of a form, to do some processing before the requestor's form
values are set into the specified bashee.




\item [Check-sanity]
\index{Check-sanity
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{NIL or error object}

 This function checks the "sanity" of this object. By
default, it checks that following the object's root-path from the root resolves
to this object. If the act of following the root-path throws an error, this error
will be returned. Otherwise, if the result of following the root-path does not
match the identity of this object, an error is thrown indicating this. Otherwise,
NIL is returned and no error is thrown. You can override this function to do what
you wish. It should return NIL if the object is found to be "sane" and an throw
an error otherwise.
If check-sanity? is set to T in this object, this function will be invoked automatically
within an ignore-errors by the function handling the GWL "/answer" form action URI
when this object is a respondent, before the main-sheet is presented.




\item [Process-cookies!]
\index{Process-cookies!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This is an empty function by default, but can be overridden in
a user specialization of base-html-sheet, to do some processing before the
header-plist is evaluated and before the HTTP response is actually initiated, but after
the cookies-received have been set.




\item [Restore-form-controls!]
\index{Restore-form-controls!
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Calls restore-defaults! on all the form-controls in this sheet.




\item [Sanity-error]
\index{Sanity-error
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Emits a page explaining the sanity error. This will be invoked instead of the write-main-sheet
if check-sanity? is set to T and the check-sanity throws an error. You may override this function to
do what you wish. By default a minimal error message is displayed and a link to the root object
is presented.




\item [Select-choices]
\index{Select-choices
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Writes an HTML Select field with Options.




\item [Write-child-links]
\index{Write-child-links
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Creates a default unordered list with links to each child part of self.
The text of the links will come from each child's strings-for-display.




\item [Write-development-links]
\index{Write-development-links
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Writes links for access to the standard developer views of the object, currently consisting
of an update (Refresh!) link, a Break link, and a ta2 link.




\item [Write-html-sheet]
\index{Write-html-sheet
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 This GDL function should be redefined to generate the HTML page corresponding to this object.
It can be specified here, or as the \texttt{main-sheet} output-function in an html-format lens for this
object's type. This \texttt{write-html-sheet} function, if defined,  will override any \texttt{main-sheet}
function defined in the lens. Typically a \texttt{write-html-sheet} function would look as follows:




\item [Write-self-link]
\index{Write-self-link
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Emits a hyperlink pointing to self. Note that if you need extra customization
on the display-string (e.g. to include an image tag or other arbitrary markup), use with-output-to-string
in conjunction with the html-stream macro.




\item [Write-standard-footer]
\index{Write-standard-footer
[base-html-sheet]}\emph{Void}

 Writes some standard footer information. Defaults to writing Genworks and Franz
copyright and product links. Note that VAR agreements often require that you include a ``powered by''
link to the vendor on public web pages.

are all the keyword symbols representing the settable computed-slots and input-slots which have a default value. Required
input-slots (i.e. input-slots without a default value) are not included in this list. If you wish to include required
inputs with the saved-slots, you should explicitly append them to this list when specifying the \texttt{saved-slots}.

 Reads the slots data from \texttt{filename}, restores the corresponding slots in this
object and matching descendant objects, and calls the \texttt{restore!} function on each object.





\item [Write-html-sheet]
\index{Write-html-sheet
[layout-mixin]}\emph{Void}

 This GDL function should be redefined to generate the HTML page corresponding to this object.
It can be specified here, or as the \texttt{main-sheet} output-function in an html-format lens for this
object's type. This \texttt{write-html-sheet} function, if defined,  will override any \texttt{main-sheet}
function defined in the lens. Typically a \texttt{write-html-sheet} function would look as follows:




\item [Write-saved-slots]
\index{Write-saved-slots
[layout-mixin]}\emph{Void}

 Writes the unique application name names and values of all saved-slots in this and all
descendants which are of type node-mixin or application-mixin.

\begin{description}

\item [
\underline{Description}]


Basic mixin to support constructing a gdl ajax call 
relative to this node. Note that in order for a node to represent a section of a 
web page, you should use sheet-section (which mixes this in), rather than this raw 
primitive. 

This is a mixin into base-html-sheet, and some of the previous base-html-sheet 
functionality has been factored out into this mixin. 

Of special note in this object is thefunction \texttt{gdl-ajax-call} which generates 
Javascript appropriate for attaching with a UI event, e.g. onclick, onchange, 
onblur, etc. In this Javascript you can specify a GDL function (on this object, self) 
to be run, and/or specify a list of form-control objects which are rendered on 
the current page, whose values should be submitted and processed ("bashed") into the 
server.

\begin{description}

\item [Bashee]
\index{Bashee
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{GDL Object}

 Object to have its settable computed-slots and/or query-plist set
from the fields on the form upon submission. Defaults to self.




\item [Dom-id]
\index{Dom-id
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{String}

 This is the auto-computed dom-id which should be used for rendering
this section. If you use the main-div HTML string for rendering this object as a
page section, then you do not have to generate the :div tag yourself - the main-div
will be a string of HTML which is wrapped in the correct :div tag already.




\item [Force-validation-for]
\index{Force-validation-for
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{List of GDL objects of type form-control}

 The validation-function will be forced
on these objects when a form is submitted, even if the object's html form-control does
not happen to be included in the values submitted with the form. Defaults to nil.




\item [Inner-html]
\index{Inner-html
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{String}

 This can be used with (str .) [in cl-who] or (:princ .) [in htmlGen]
to output this section of the page, without the wrapping :div tag [so if you use this,
your code would be responsible for wrapping the :div tag with :id (the dom-id).]




\item [Js-to-eval]
\index{Js-to-eval
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{String of valid Javascript}

 This Javascript will be send with the Ajax response,
and evaluated after the innerHTML for this section has been replaced.

\index{Form-controls
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{List of GDL objects}

 All the children or hidden-children
of type base-form-control.




\item [Html-sections]
\index{Html-sections
[skeleton-ui-element]}

List of HTML sections to be scanned and possibly replaced in response to
GDL Ajax calls. Override this slot at your own risk. The default is all
sections who are most recently laid out on the respondent sheet, and
this is set programmatically every time the sheet section's main-div
is demanded.




\item [Main-div%]
\index{Main-div%
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{String}

 This should be used with (str .) [in cl-who] or (:princ .)
[in htmlGen] to output this section of the page, including the wrapping :div tag.




\item [Ordered-form-controls]
\index{Ordered-form-controls
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{List of GDL objects, which should be of type 'base-form-control}

.



[Note -- this slot is not really necessary for protecting out-of-bounds sequence references
anymore, the form-control processor protects against this by itself now].



These objects are validated and bashed first, in the order given. If the cardinality
of one form-control depends on another as in the example below, then you should list
those dependent objects first. Default is nil.




\item [Possible-nils]
\index{Possible-nils
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{List of keyword symbols}

 Messages corresponding to form fields which could
be missing from form submission (e.g. checkbox fields). Defaults to the names
of any children or hidden-children of type  menu-form-control or
checkbox-form-control.




\item [Preset-all?]
\index{Preset-all?
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{Boolean}

 This switch determines whether all form-controls should be preset
before the final setting, in order to allow any interdependencies to be detected
for validation or detecting changed values. If this is specified as a non-nil
value, then any nil values of (the preset?) on individual form controls will be
ignored. If this is specified as nil, then (the preset?) of individual
form-controls (default of these is also nil) will be respected. Default is nil.

\textbf{
\underline{Gdl functions:}}

\begin{description}

\item [Gdl-ajax-call]
\index{Gdl-ajax-call
[skeleton-ui-element]}\emph{String}

This function returns a string of Javascript, appropriate to use for events
such as :onclick, :onchange, etc, which will invoke an Ajax request to the
server, which will respond by replacing the innerHTML of affected :div's, and
running the Javascript interpreter to evaluate (the js-to-eval), if any.
